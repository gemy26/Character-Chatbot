EXT. AFGHANISTAN/JOHN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 1880
1
1
A blizzard of shots. 
A foreign battlefield at night.
The crackle of gunfire. 
Now on a dimly glimpsed figure in bed, tossing and turning in 
a nightmare.
Close on the glitter of metal. Bayonets, clashing. 
Over this, a voice. Almost familiar - the voice of John 
Watson. John Watson as he might have sounded had he lived 
many years ago.
JOHN
(V.O.)
The Second Afghan War brought 
honours and promotion to many -
Someone is running, their breath ragged. 
Suddenly, the night sky is lit up by an explosion. 
And everything’s red. 
Not blood. 
Not fire. 
But the glimpse of a uniform. A red uniform. Its braiding 
glints in the afterglow of the explosion. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
(V.O.)
- but for me it meant nothing but
misfortune and disaster.
The crack of a rifle. The owner of the uniform is spun 
backwards into the night and -
In the bedroom, John Watson awakes, sitting up, recovering. 
Just another nightmare. 
He lets his breathing return to normal.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. VICTORIAN LONDON - DAY 1

A murky, lowering sky - pillars of smoke rising into it.

JOHN
(V.O.)
I returned to England with my 
health irretrievably ruined and my 
future bleak. Under such 
circumstances, I naturally 
gravitated to London -
- panning down now to discover the great sprawling, smoking, 
furnace of Victorian London.
JOHN (CONT’D)
- that great cesspool into which
all the loungers and idlers of the
empire are drained.
Now cutting, around Victorian London - fast, punchy, choppy. 
Not the cardboard Victoriana of Hollywood - this is muddy and 
clattering and fast. Belching steam trains, and clattering 
cabs and all the filthy torrent of humanity.
Now on one figure, marching grimly against the tide: Dr. John 
Watson. This is the John we know, but careworn and tanned. 
The stick is back, he limps along. (NB - at this point, clean 
shaven.)  
Now, a voice calling:
STAMFORD
Watson! Watson!
John turns. A portly figure, pushing his way through the 
throng. Stamford (identical to the Mike Stamford we saw A 
Study In Pink.) He’s grabbed John’s hand, is pumping it 
furiously.
STAMFORD (CONT’D)
Stamford, remember? We were at 
Barts together.
JOHN
Yes, of course, Stamford.
STAMFORD
Good lord, man, where have you 
been? You’re as brown as a nut.
On John’s face: that haunted look. Not a story he likes 
telling ...
CUT TO:
INT. CRITERION BAR - DAY 1

A corner table in the packed pub. Stamford is staring, a 
little shocked at John’s account of his adventures.

(CONTINUED)


Big in the foreground, John sets down his glass with shaking 
hand.
STAMFORD
You poor devil.
John just shrugs.
JOHN
I made it home. Many weren’t so 
lucky.
STAMFORD
So what now?
JOHN
Need a place to live - somewhere 
decent at an affordable price. Not 
easy.
STAMFORD
You know, you’re the second person 
to say that to me today?
JOHN
Who was the first?
Swish, crack, and -
CUT TO:
INT. BARTS/CORRIDOR - DAY 1
4
4
A long narrow corridor, frosted glass windows along one side, 
looking on to another room. A shadow of the room’s occupant 
flaps grotesquely against the misted windows - a man slashing 
away with a riding crop. Now panning to:
John and Stamford, entering the corridor. 
Swish-crack!
JOHN
Good Lord.
STAMFORD
It’s an experiment, apparently. 
Beating corpses to establish how 
long after death bruising is still 
possible.
JOHN
Is there a medical point to that?
STAMFORD
I’m not sure.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
3.
(CONTINUED)


JOHN
Neither am I. So where’s this 
friend of yours then?
He’s marching on down the corridor -
- but Stamford has halted, a little apologetically, by the 
door to the dissecting room.
Swish-crack!
John gets it. No! Not him!
CUT TO:
INT. DISSECTING ROOM - DAY 1

5
On Stamford and John as they come through the door - 
- rows of tables, with sheeted bodies, and just out of shot -
- swish crack!
STAMFORD
Excuse me?
JOHN
I hope we’re not interrupting.
And SHERLOCK snaps up into a close-up. Those blazing, green 
eyes, as ever, but the hair slicked back - he looks colder 
and more exact: this is Victorian Holmes.
SHERLOCK 
You’ve been in Afghanistan, I 
perceive.
STAMFORD
Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherl -
Whack!! 
- Sherlock has thrown the riding crop at John, who
instinctively catches it.
SHERLOCK
Excellent reflexes - you’ll do.
JOHN
I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK
I have my eye on a suite of rooms 
near Regents Park. Between us we 
could afford them. 
He’s pulling on his coat, striding for the door.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
4.
(CONTINUED)


JOHN
Rooms? Who said anything about 
rooms?
SHERLOCK 
I did. I mentioned to Stamford this 
morning that I was in need of a 
fellow lodger, and now he appears 
after lunch in the company of a man 
of military aspect with a tan and a 
recent injury, both suggestive of 
the campaign in Afghanistan and an 
enforced departure from it. The 
conclusion seemed inescapable. 
We’ll meet tomorrow evening, and 
finalise the details. Now if you’ll 
excuse me, I have a hanging in 
Wandsworth and I’d hate them to 
start without me.
JOHN
A hanging??
SHERLOCK
I take a professional interest. I 
also play the violin and smoke a 
pipe. I take it that’s not a 
problem?
JOHN
Well, no, I -
SHERLOCK 
And you’re clearly acclimatized to 
never getting to the end of a 
sentence - we’ll get on splendidly. 
Tomorrow, seven o’clock then.
(Moves to go, pops his 
head back round the door)
Oh! The name’s Sherlock Holmes and 
the address is 221B Baker Street. 
He goes.
A stunned silence. John looks to Stamford.
STAMFORD
Yes. He’s always been like that. 
TITLES.

As we know them - but Victorian! 
Piccadilly Circus, swarming with horse-drawn traffic. 
The Palace of Westminster.

(CONTINUED)


An army service revolver. John is loading it. 
Sherlock thrashing with a cane at a poisonous snake!
Sherlock and John contemplating a large felt hat.
Sherlock and John running down a fog-shrouded, cobbled 
street.
Scribbled hand-written notes and the tap-tap-tap of the 
telegraph.  
Close on Sherlock’s eye through a big, old-fashioned 
magnifying glass. 
CUT TO:
EXT. VICTORIAN LONDON - DAY 2
7
7
A busy street. Hansom cabs clopping along. It’s cold, 
possibly even snowing. A few hints here and there that 
Christmas is not far off.
A news stand - with a wooden-legged NEWSVENDOR. Many copies 
of The Strand being sold - even a queue -
- and now a hansom cab is drawing up at the kerb. A head pops 
out of the window.
It’s JOHN. Time has passed - he looks healthy and happy, and 
now sports a proper Watson moustache.
JOHN
How’s the The Blue Carbuncle doing?
NEWSVENDOR
Very popular, Dr Watson. But is 
there going to a proper murder next 
month?
JOHN
I’ll have a word with the criminal 
classes.
NEWSVENDOR
If you wouldn’t mind.
From inside the cab, a puff of smoke - like someone is in 
there, smoking. The Newsvendor sees this -
NEWSVENDOR (CONT’D)
Is that him? Is he in there?
A thump and John startles like someone just kicked him in the 
shin.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
6.
(CONTINUED)


JOHN
No, no, not at all. Good day to 
you!
And the hansom cab moves swiftly on. The newsvendor looks 
after it, awestruck. It was him!!
NEWSVENDOR
Merry Christmas, Mr. Holmes.
CUT TO:
INT. BAKER STREET - DAY 2

The sign: Baker Street!
The door: 221B!
The door flies open, and the Victorian version of Mrs Hudson 
comes flying out, to see:
Sherlock and John climbing out of the cab. 
MRS HUDSON
Mr. Holmes, I do wish you’d let me 
know when you’re planning to come 
home! 
On Sherlock as he steps to the pavement, deerstalker cap, 
Inverness cape, pipe clenched in his teeth: a hero shot. 
SHERLOCK in the traditional style.
SHERLOCK 
I hardly knew myself, Mrs. Hudson. 
That’s the trouble with dismembered  
country squires - they’re 
notoriously difficult to schedule.
MRS HUDSON
Billy, fetch the cases.
A page boy, dashing to get the cases from the cab. (It’s the 
Page Boy from The Sign Of Three.) John has a hat box. 
BILLY
Did you catch the murderer, Mr. 
Holmes?
SHERLOCK 
Caught the murderer, still looking 
for the legs. I think we’ll call it 
a draw.
BILLY
(of the hat box)
What’s in there?
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
7.
(CONTINUED)


JOHN
Never mind.
MRS HUDSON
And I notice you’ve published 
another of your stories, Dr Watson.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
7A.
(CONTINUED)


JOHN
Did you enjoy it?
MRS HUDSON
No.
JOHN
... are you sure?
MRS HUDSON
I never enjoy them.
JOHN
Why not?
MRS HUDSON
Because I never say anything, do I? 
According to you, I just show 
people up the stairs, and serve you 
breakfast. 
JOHN
Well. Within the narrative, that 
is, broadly speaking, your 
function.
MRS HUDSON
My what??
Billy is heading up the stairs. The others follow, squabbling 
amiably.
SHERLOCK
You mustn’t feel singled out, Mrs 
Hudson, I’m hardly in the dog one.
JOHN
(Affronted)
The dog one??
MRS HUDSON
I’m your landlady, not a plot 
device.
JOHN
Do you mean the Hound Of The 
Baskervilles??
MRS HUDSON
And you make the rooms look so drab 
and dingy. 
JOHN
Oh, blame it on the illustrator, 
he’s out of control. I’ve had to 
grow this moustache just so people 
will recognise me.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

(CONTINUED)


Pulling back from 221b now, as our heroes disappear inside. A 
proper view of the Victorian residence, hansom cabs speeding 
past. Just below the famous residence is Speedwell’s 
Restaurant and Tea Rooms.
JOHN (CONT’D)
(V.O.)
Over the many years it has been my 
privilege to record the exploits of 
my remarkable friend, Mr. Sherlock 
Holmes, it has sometimes been 
difficult to choose which of his 
many cases to set before my 
readers. 
CUT TO:
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY 2

The familiar room, but the blinds are lowered - in the 
shadows, we can’t quite see the differences from the modern 
version. SHERLOCK is now crossing to the window, raising the 
blind.
Cutting round the room, as the light picks all the many 
changes from the modern room we’re used to.
JOHN
(V.O.)
The extraordinary affair of the 
adamantine menagerie is perhaps too 
recent in the minds of the public 
to bear repetition, while the 
terrible events concerning 
Professor Challenger and his flying 
leeches is a matter for which the 
world is not yet prepared. But in 
all our many adventures together, 
no case pushed my friend to such 
mental and physical extremes as 
that of ... 
Sherlock now raising the second blind -
- revealing a veiled woman, dressed all in black, standing in 
front of the fireplace.
JOHN (CONT’D)
(V.O.)
... the abominable bride.
Sherlock turns to see her, just as John enters and does the 
same.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Good lord!
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

(CONTINUED)


Sherlock frowns at the motionless figure, almost bristles - 
Victorian Holmes does not appreciate an unexpected woman in 
his apartment. He strides to the door, bellowing down the 
stairs.
SHERLOCK 
Mrs. Hudson, there’s a woman in my 
sitting room - is it intentional?
MRS HUDSON
(From off)
She’s a client. Said you were out, 
insisted on waiting.
John, slightly nervously approaches the still, solemn figure.
JOHN
Would you care to sit down?
The veiled woman just cocks her head at him - silent, 
sinister.
SHERLOCK
(Yelling down)
Didn’t you ask her what she wanted?
MRS HUDSON
(From off)
You ask her!
SHERLOCK 
Why didn’t you ask her?
MRS HUDSON
(From off)
How could I, what with me never 
talking, and everything!
Sherlock rolls his eyes, rejoins John.
SHERLOCK
For God’s sake, give her some 
lines. She’s perfectly capable of 
starving us.
(To the veiled woman)
Good afternoon, I am Sherlock 
Holmes. This is my friend and 
colleague, Dr Watson - you may 
speak freely in front of him as he 
rarely understands a word.
JOHN
Holmes!
SHERLOCK 
Before you do, however, allow me to 
make some trifling observations. 
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
10.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)


You have an impish sense of humour, 
which you are currently deploying 
to ease a degree of personal 
anguish. You have recently married 
a man, seemingly of kindly 
disposition who has now abandoned 
you for an unsavoury companion of 
dubious morals. You have come to 
this agency as a last resort, in 
hope that reconciliation may still 
be possible.
JOHN
Good lord, Holmes.
SHERLOCK
All this is, of course, perfectly 
evident from your perfume. Pray be 
seated.
JOHN
Her perfume?
They are now in the accustomed chair - the woman in the 
client chair, facing the fireplace.
SHERLOCK 
Her perfume, yes - which brings 
insight to me, and disaster to you.
JOHN
How so?
SHERLOCK 
Because I recognised it -
He leans over and throws back the lady’s veil -
- revealing Mary Watson. Who looks sardonically at John.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
- and you didn’t.
JOHN
Mary!
MARY
John!
JOHN
Why in God’s name are you 
pretending to be a client??
MARY
Because I could think of no other 
way to see my husband, husband.

INT. 221B BAKER STREET - EVENING 2

A little while later.
Sherlock (now with his dressing gown thrown over his tweeds) 
stands at the window, playing away at his violin - we might 
recognise it as Waltz For Mary And John from The Sign Of 
Three.
Behind him, drowned out by the violin, Mary and John are 
having something of a domestic, which we barely hear over the 
music!
JOHN
It was an affair of international 
intrigue.
MARY
It was a murdered country squire -
JOHN
Nevertheless, matters were pressing 
-
MARY
I don’t mind you going, darling - I 
mind you leaving me behind. 
JOHN
But what could you do?
MARY
What do you do, except wander 
around taking notes, and looking 
surprised??
Suddenly a discordant note from the violin. This causes Mary 
and John to startle and turn to look at him. Sherlock throws 
aside the violin, looks fiercely out of the window.
SHERLOCK 
Enough! The stage is set, the 
curtain rises - we are ready to 
begin.
Mary and John exchange a look. 
MARY
Begin what? 
Sherlock is staring out of the window. Abstracted, haunted.
SHERLOCK 
Sometimes to solve a case, one must 
first solve another.
JOHN
You have a case then? A new one?
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
12.
(CONTINUED)


SHERLOCK 
An old one. Very old. I shall have 
to go deep. 
JOHN 
Deep? Into what?
Oh Sherlock, still staring out of the window.
We move in on the window, the Victorian evening outside, the 
gas lamps, the cabs.
SHERLOCK 
Myself!
Abruptly, we roll focus to bring Sherlock’s reflection into 
focus for a fleeting  moment -
- barely long enough to realise we are looking at modern 
Sherlock, in his coat and turned up collar -
- this spectre of the future hangs above the Victorian street  
scene for the tiniest moment -
- and before we are sure what we are looking at - 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Lestrade!
He spins round from the window, now back to his Victorian 
self.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Do stop loitering by the door and 
come in.
The door pushes open - revealing the Victorian version of 
Inspector Lestrade, complete with mutton chop whiskers and 
Derby hat.
LESTRADE
How did you know it was me?
SHERLOCK 
The regulation tread is 
unmistakable. Too light for Jones, 
too heavy for Gregson. 
LESTRADE
Sorry - I just came up, Mrs. Hudson 
didn’t seem to be ... talking.
SHERLOCK 
I fear she has branched into 
literary criticism by means of 
satire - it is a distressing trend 
in the modern landlady. What brings 
you here in your off-duty hours?
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
13.
(CONTINUED)


LESTRADE
How do you know I’m off duty?
SHERLOCK
Since arrival you have addressed 
over forty percent of your remarks 
to my decanter. Watson, give the 
inspector what he so clearly wants.
John busies himself pouring a drink.
JOHN
What can we do for you, Lestrade?
LESTRADE
I’m not here on business, I just 
thought I’d ...drop by.
Sherlock and John look at each other.
JOHN
A social call?
LESTRADE
Of course. To wish you the 
compliments of the season.
(An uneasy pause, in the 
face of scepticism)
Merry Christmas.
A look among Sherlock and the Watsons.
SHERLOCK 
Merry Christmas.
JOHN
Merry Christmas.
MARY
Merry Christmas.
SHERLOCK 
Well thank God that’s over. Now 
Inspector, what strange happening 
compels you to my door, but 
embarrasses you to relate?
LESTRADE
(Defensive)
Who said anything happened?
SHERLOCK
You did, by every means short of 
actual speech.
JOHN
Holmes, you have misdiagnosed.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
14.
(CONTINUED)


SHERLOCK 
Then correct me, doctor.
John has plucked the now empty glass from Lestrade’s hand, 
shows it to Sherlock.
JOHN
He didn’t want a drink, he needed
one. He’s not embarrassed - he’s 
afraid.
SHERLOCK
My Boswell is learning - they grow 
up so fast. 
(He tosses the empty glass 
to Mary)
Mary, restore the courage of 
Scotland Yard. Inspector, do sit 
down.
JOHN
I’ll get my notebook.
Lestrade, a little uncertainly, takes the client chair, as 
Mary hands him a drink.
LESTRADE
I’m not afraid exactly ...
SHERLOCK
Fear is wisdom in the face of 
danger - it is nothing to be 
ashamed of.
He grabs his pipe and matches.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
From the beginning then!
He strikes his match with a great flourish and -
- blam!! -
- and the striking match becomes:
CUT TO:
EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY 1A FLASHBACK

11
The exploding muzzle of a gun as it fires!
- now on young man - ALF - as he staggers back, his face and
shirt front sprayed with blood, staring in horror. Confused,
horrified, what the hell just happened??
Wider: an ordinary London street. Alf stands on the pavement, 
in the bustle -
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
15.
(CONTINUED)


- next to him, in the street, a horse tied up at a cab rank.
- Alf, staring in confusion at the blood drenching him - a
woman is screaming a she sees him.
On Alf - a beat of confusion: he’s not hit, he’s not hurt. 
ALF
What in God’s name - ?
Then there is a horrible whinnying gurgle.
- the horse starts, slowly and dreadfully, to crumple to the
ground. It has been shot! (The blood from the wound has
sprayed over Alf.)
Alf staring in incomprehension.
CABBIE
Somebody shot my -
Blam! The window in the cab shatters.
Now people running, screaming --
-- someone is shooting, someone has a gun --
On Alf: staring up - oh my God!!
The house opposite - there’s a high window, a little balcony 
over-looking the street -
- and standing there, THE BRIDE!! A woman, a traditional 
wedding dress fluttering in the breeze -
- and revolvers in her hand!
On her face - 
- deadly white, her mouth a red slash, her eyes crazed -
The revolvers now swivelling around, looking for a target. 
Close on her hideous, red slash of a mouth as she screams -
THE BRIDE
You!!
And the revolvers swing round to level at -
- a man, GILES, puffing along the screen, trying to get out 
of the line of fire.
He stumbles to a halt, transfixed -
- the gun muzzles levelled at him, those deranged staring 
eyes -
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
16.
(CONTINUED)


GILES
No! Please, no, don’t!
But suddenly the guns swing again, now pointing at -
- the cabbie with the dead horse, still seated where he was, 
staring in shock!
THE BRIDE
You!!
The cabbie throws himself off the cab, out of sight.
The Bride swings her guns round again -
- a young man, trying to scramble out of sight in a doorway.
THE BRIDE (CONT’D)
You!!
He flattens himself against the door.
The revolvers swing again, this time zeroing on - 
- blood-soaked Alf, the dead horse still slumped in front of 
him. He stares at the Bride, transfixed in shock.
On the Bride - it’s like she’s settled on him. The crimson 
slash of a mouth breaks into a terrible, grin.
THE BRIDE (CONT’D)
You!!
The young man in the doorway sees his chance, makes a run for 
it. We pan with him as races across the street, until -
SHERLOCK
(From)
A moment!
- and the picture freezes, the man caught mid-run. We now
track round him, holding him a three-dimensional frozen image
to see, incongruously -
- now set up in the middle of the street, is the fireplace 
from 221b, with SHERLOCK reclining his armchair next to it, 
Lestrade in the client chair, JOHN in his chair with Mary 
sitting on the arm.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
When was this?
LESTRADE
Yesterday morning.
SHERLOCK
The Bride’s face - how was it 
described?

The group round the fireplace. Lestrade flipping through his 
notebook.
LESTRADE
(Consulting his notes.)
White as death, mouth like a 
crimson wound.
Sherlock has sprung to his feet, now paces to the window, 
staring out.
SHERLOCK
Poetry or truth?
LESTRADE
There are many who would say they 
are the same thing -
SHERLOCK
Yes, idiots - poetry or truth?
LESTRADE
I saw her face myself - afterwards.
SHERLOCK
After what?
The young man now goes running through 221b. We whip pan with 
him, as races right out of the set and on to:
CUT TO:
EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY 1A FLASHBACK

- the young man races, we pan back up to the Bride and her
revolvers.
THE BRIDE
You ... !!
Alf, whimpering with fear, drops to his knees, covers his 
head.
THE BRIDE (CONT’D)
...or me.
On Alf: still tense, waiting. What did she say?
From off - blam!
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

(CONTINUED)


Alf spasms, convulses, takes a moment to realise -
- he hasn’t been hit!! Looks up.
The balcony is empty, the window stands open, the curtains 
flap as before -
- but now there is a slash of blood across them!
We hold in this for a moment, closing in on it -
- and then Sherlock crosses the window -
SHERLOCK
Really, Inspector -
CUT TO:
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - EVENING 2

- Sherlock is now crossing in front of his own window -
SHERLOCK
- a woman blows her own brains out,
in public, and you need help
identifying the guilty party. I
fear Scotland Yard has reached a
new low.
LESTRADE
I’m not here about that.
SHERLOCK
I surmised.
DR WATSON
What was her name - the bride?
INT. EMELIA RICOLETTI’S BEDROOM - DAY 1A FLASHBACK

SHERLOCK
Standard procedure. Why are you 
telling us what may be presumed?
LESTRADE
Because of what happened next.
EXT. LIMEHOUSE ALLEY. NIGHT 1A FLASHBACK 
17
17
FOG.
Dense, swirling, impenetrable. The muffled chimes of a church 
clock sound midnight. We’re in Limehouse. Seedy, dirty, 
corrupt. A faded sign in Chinese tells us we’re outside ‘The 
Bar of Gold’. 
Now, striding through a big wooden doorway - RICOLETTI. Tall, 
30’s, with a big black moustache, evening dress.
And, like the running man, he freezes. We track round him, to 
see the Baker Street fireplace set up in the street, with 
Holmes, Lestrade and the Watsons grouped round it in their 
accustomed positions.
LESTRADE

Craaaaack!
A horsewhip sounds and suddenly a hansom cab thunders 
directly at Ricoletti, who staggers back a pace.
The cab comes to shuddering halt right before Ricoletti

The DRIVER is a stocky man, bundled up against the cold. And 
he’s pale as death - sweating. Staring at Ricoletti - clearly 
terrified for his life.
DRIVER
(To Ricoletti)
I’m sorry. She made me. She made
me.
RICOLETTI
Who made you do what? What are 
saying - ?
He breaks off as his eye goes to:
Through the shuttered hole in the cab roof protrude both 
barrels of a shotgun! 
What??
Now the shotgun withdraws. 
Now the cab door opens.
Cutting close on details. A slim ankle in soft, white leather 
boots and then the hem of a white dress. But not just any 
white dress. A wedding dress! 
The BRIDE stands before Ricoletti in a beautiful Victorian 
gown. But the delicate veil that covers her face is filthy 
and blood-stained. She raises her gloved hand and points the 
shotgun at Ricoletti. 
RICOLETTI (CONT’D)
(terrified)
Who are you?? What do you want??
The Bride jerks the shotgun towards him. Up. 
Ricoletti flinches, holding up his hands in abject submission 
The Bride gestures with the gun again. 
Back.
Ricoletti frowns then backs away slowly the way he came. He 
throws a panicked look towards the cab driver, who looks 
quickly away. No comfort there. 
RICOLETTI (CONT’D)
Who are you? Why are you doing 
this?? Just tell me who you are!!
Beat. Then, for answer ... singing. Eerie, ethereal, the 
Bride sings!

BRIDE
“Do not forget me! do not forget 
me! 
Remember the maid, the maid of the  
mill...” 
Ricoletti: staring at her now aghast. Oh my God!!
BRIDE (CONT’D)
You recognise our song, my dear, I 
sang it at our wedding.
Keeping him covered, the Bride lifts her veil with one hand, 
revealing a delicately beautiful face, white as chalk. And 
unquestionably the woman who was shooting from the window. 
RICOLETTI
E...Emelia?
DRIVER
(sotto)
Christ preserve us. 
RICOLETTI
You’re dead. You can’t be here, you 
died!
BRIDE
Am I not beautiful, Thomas? As 
beautiful as the day you married 
me?
Ricoletti gibbers in terror. 
RICOLETTI
Impossible. It’s not...possible! 
Suddenly, there are footsteps in the fog. 
RANCE (V.O.)
Alright, miss! Now be a good girl 
and put that thing down!
A young Police Constable - RANCE has appeared. 
BRIDE
Put it down?
(smiles)
If you insist!
She swings the gun towards Ricoletti.
RANCE
No! No! For God’s sake, think what 
you’re doing! What the hell’s all 
this about?
The Bride turns to him.

BRIDE
What does it look like, my handsome 
friend? 
She aims the gun. 
BRIDE (CONT’D)
It’s a shotgun wedding!
BOOOOM!
She lets fly with both barrels and Ricoletti is blasted in 
the chest and catapulted backwards onto the cobbles --
-- but as he lands, we cut to him landing in --

Rance races towards the body. 
RANCE
Oh my God, you’ve done for him! 
Help! Help! Murder! MURDER!
The Bride just smiles again and puts her veil back into 
place. She hurls the shotgun to the ground and walks slowly 
away.
Rance makes to follow her then stops dead in his tracks. 
The back of the Bride’s head is now visible. Or, rather, what 
should be the back of her head. Instead, it’s a mess of 
compacted blood and gore. Then she’s swallowed up by the fog. 
Rance snaps out of his trance and follows - but she’s gone! 
He can’t be more than a few feet behind but there’s 
absolutely no sign of the Bride. The fog swirls around Rance, 
as if mocking him. At last he races back to the hansom cab.

RANCE (CONT’D)
Bloody hell, they’ll skin me alive 
if I’ve lost her. You! You saw it 
all! You saw her. 
The Driver nods slowly. 
DRIVER
I saw her. Mrs Emelia Ricoletti. 
Rance sighs with relief. 
RANCE
Right. That’s something then.  
Where does she live?
Beat.
DRIVER
Where does she live? She doesn’t 
live anywhere. She blew her brains 
out yesterday!

Extraordinary.

Sherlock leaps to his feet, exuberant.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Suicide as street theatre, murder 
by corpse - and it’s not even 
Christmas yet! Lestrade, you’re 
spoiling us. Watson, your hat and 
boots.
JOHN
Where are we going?
SHERLOCK
The morgue - there’s not a moment 
to lose. Which one can so rarely 
say of a morgue.
MARY
Am I supposed just to sit here?
JOHN
Not at all, my dear - we’ll be 
hungry later.
(To Sherlock)
Holmes, just one thing ... tweeds
in a morgue?
SHERLOCK
Needs must when the devil drives, 
Watson.
He claps his deerstalker to his head and off they dash. Mary, 
seething. Lestrade gives her a nod -
LESTRADE
Ma’am.

MRS HUDSON
Never mind, my dear. Ooh, almost

She hands over an envelope. Mary: instantly curious, alert - 
like she recognises the stationery. She rips open the 
envelope, a card falls into her hand.
On screen text: in immaculate handwriting, a single word: 
Immediately.
She flips the card over. On the rear side is a single letter:
M.
Mary smiles - you’d almost think the game was afoot.
MARY
Tell my husband I’ll be late home - 
I have some urgent business.
MRS HUDSON
Is everything all right?
MARY
Oh, you know - just a friend in 
need.
MRS HUDSON
Oh dear, what friend?
Mary, at the door, turns back. Pushing in on her, hero shot,

On the slab lies the sheeted body of the Bride -

- and the corpse has been chained and manacled to the table.
SHERLOCK
Please tell me which idiot did 
this??
Now on: a man in his shirt sleeves, clearly working here: 
it’s Anderson!
ANDERSON
It’s for everyone’s safety.
John has already stepped forward, pulling back the top of the 
sheet -
- to reveal the terrible face of the Bride, still and waxen 
in death.
JOHN
This woman is dead. Half her head 
is missing, she isn’t a threat to 
anyone.
ANDERSON
Tell that to her husband - he’s 
under a sheet in the next room.
SHERLOCK
Whatever happened in Limehouse last 
night, I think we can safely assume 
it wasn’t the work of a dead woman.
ANDERSON
Stranger things have happened.
SHERLOCK
Such as?
ANDERSON
Well. Strange things.
JOHN
You’re talking like a child. 
SHERLOCK
And this is clearly man’s work. 
Where is he? 
The creak of a door, light falls across the room, the shadow 
of a new arrival.
HOOPER
Mr. Holmes!
Hero shot, pushing in on -
Impossibly, it’s Molly Hooper. But dressed a man. It just 
about works - thin, with fine features, a moustache.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

(CONTINUED)


Holmes gives him (her) a guarded nod. They’re almost squaring 
up to each other.
SHERLOCK
Hooper.
HOOPE
Holmes.
(Shoots a look at 
Anderson)
You. Back to work.
Anderson turns, picks up a mop and pail and continues 
swabbing the tiled floor. 
Hooper and Sherlock lock eyes. Clearly there is bitter 
history here.
HOOPER
So. Come to astonish us with your 
magic tricks, I suppose.  
SHERLOCK
Is there anything to which you’d 
like to draw my attention?
HOOPER
Nothing at all, Mr. Holmes. You may 
leave any time you wish.
LESTRADE
Dr. Hooper, I asked Mr. Holmes to 
come here - co-operate. That’s an 
order.
Hooper shoots him a sour look - oh, all right.
HOOPER
There are two “features of 
interest” as you’re always saying 
in Dr Watson’s stories.
SHERLOCK
I never say that.
JOHN
You do, actually. Quite a lot.
HOOPER
First of all, this is definitely 
Emelia Ricoletti. She has been 
categorically identified. Beyond 
doubt, this is her.
JOHN
Then who was that in Limehouse last 
night?
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
28.
(CONTINUED)


HOOPER
That was also Emelia Ricoletti.
JOHN
It can’t have been. She was dead, 
she was here.
HOOPER
She was positively identified by 
her own husband seconds before he 
died. He had no reason to lie, and 
could hardly have been mistaken.
LESTRADE
The cabbie knew her too. No 
question it was her.
Sherlock, now frowning. This is tricky.
JOHN
But she can’t have been in two 
places at the same time, can she?
SHERLOCK
No, Watson. One place is strictly 
the limit for the recently 
deceased.
JOHN
Holmes! Could it have been twins?
SHERLOCK
No.
JOHN
Why not?
SHERLOCK
Because it’s never twins.
LESTRADE
Emelia was not a twin, nor did she 
have any sisters. She had one older 
brother who died four years ago.
JOHN
Well - maybe there was a ... secret
twin?
SHERLOCK
A what??
JOHN
You know. A secret twin. A twin, 
that nobody knew about. This whole 
thing could’ve been planned..
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
29.
(CONTINUED)


SHERLOCK
Since the moment of conception? How 
breathtakingly prescient of her. 
It’s never twins, Watson.
JOHN
Then what’s your theory?
SHERLOCK
More to the point -
(Rounds on Lestrade)
What’s your problem?
LESTRADE
I don’t understand.
SHERLOCK
Why were you so frightened? Nothing 
so far has justified your assault 
on my decanter. You’ve allowed a 
dead body to be placed under arrest 
...
HOOPER
Ah. That would be the other feature 
of interest.
Hooper has raised the right hand of the dead woman, 
indicating a smear of blood on the forefinger.
JOHN
A smear of blood on the finger? 
That could’ve happened any number 
of ways.
HOOPER
Oh, indeed. There’s just one thing. 
It wasn’t there earlier.
Lestrade has picked up a gas lamp from a table, now raises it 
to illuminate something on the wall ...
LESTRADE
And neither was that!
The word YOU is smeared in blood on the wall.
They all stare. Sherlock, in particular, is fascinated. And 
silent.
JOHN
... Holmes? Say something.
When Sherlock speaks, he is staring at the words - haunted, 
thrilling to the moment.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

(CONTINUED)


SHERLOCK
A gun in the mouth. A bullet 
through the brain. The back of the 
head blown clean off. How could he 
survive?
The others exchange glances.
JOHN
“She”, you mean?
SHERLOCK
... I’m sorry?
JOHN
Not “he”. “She”.
SHERLOCK
... yes. Yes, of course.
(Brightens, back to 
business)
Thank you, all, for a fascinating 
case. I’ll send you a telegram when 
I’ve solved it. Watson!
And he sweeps out of the room -
- as he passes a mirror, we seem fleetingly reflected - but 
again as the modern Sherlock, in his coat and scarf. As last 
time, this is so fast we can’t be sure.
John turns to Hooper. With Sherlock gone, he’s slightly 
different - crisper, more business-like.
JOHN
The gunshot wound was obviously the 
cause of death, but there are some 
clear indicators of consumption. 
Might be worth a post-mortem, we 
need all the information we can 
get.
HOOPER
Oh, isn’t he observant, now that 
Daddy’s gone.
JOHN
I’m observant in some ways -
(Lands such a level gaze 
on her)
- just as Holmes is quite blind in
others.
HOOPER
Really?
JOHN
Yes. Really.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

(CONTINUED)


He holds Hooper’s look for a moment - then very pointedly, 
raises his hat to her. As he might, if there were a lady 
present.
Hooper almost blushes. He’s on to her.
John claps his hat back on, and sweeps out after Sherlock.
JOHN (CONT’D)
(As he goes)
Amazing what one has to do to get 
ahead in a man’s world!
ANDERSON
What’s he saying that for? 
HOOPER
Get back to work!

Sherlock and John in the cab, Sherlock silent and smoking his

Well, Holmes? Surely you must have 
some theory??
A silence. Then:
SHERLOCK
Not yet. These are deep waters, 
Watson, deep waters. 
(Frowns abstracted)
And I shall have to go deeper still 
...
And he falls into silence, staring abstractedly out of the 
window.
Now on Watson, watching him - frowning, troubled.

It was not for several months that 
we were to pick up the threads of 
this strange case again...

A plaintive Lestrade is following Sherlock about, as if 
trying to get his attention.
JOHN (V.O.)
- and then under very unexpected
circumstances...
LESTRADE
Five of them now - all the same, 
every one of them.
SHERLOCK
Hush, please, this is a matter of 
supreme importance. 
LESTRADE
What is?
SHERLOCK
The obliquity of the ecliptic. I 
have to understand it.
LESTRADE
What is it?
SHERLOCK
I don’t know, I’m still trying to 
understand it.
LESTRADE
I thought you understood 
everything.
SHERLOCK
Of course I don’t, that would be an 
appalling waste of brain space - I 
specialize.
LESTRADE
Then what’s so important about 
this?
SHERLOCK
What’s so important about five 
boring murders?
LESTRADE
They’re not boring. Five men dead, 
murdered in their own homes. Rice 
on the floor, like at a wedding - 
and the word YOU written in blood 
on the wall.
(A beat)
It’s her. It’s the Bride. Somehow 
she’s risen again -
SHERLOCK
Solved it.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

(CONTINUED)


LESTRADE
You can’t have solved it.
SHERLOCK
Of course I’ve solved it, it’s 
simple. The incident of the 
mysterious Mrs Ricoletti, the 
killer from the beyond the grave, 
has been widely reported in the 
popular press. Now people are 
disguising their own dull little 
murders as the work of a ghost to 
confuse the an impossibly imbecilic 
Scotland Yard. There you are, 
solved. Pay Mrs. Hudson a visit on 
the way out, she likes to feel 
involved.
LESTRADE
... You sure?
SHERLOCK
Certainly, go away. 
(Spins round)
Watson, I’m ready - we have an 
important appointment. Your hat and 
boots.
But he is addressing an empty chair. Where’s he gone?
LESTRADE
Didn’t Dr. Watson move out a few 
months ago?
SHERLOCK
He did, didn’t he? Who have I been 
talking to all this time?
LESTRADE
Well speaking on behalf of the 
impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard, 
that chair is definitely empty.
SHERLOCK
Yes, it is. Works surprisingly well 
though. Actually, I thought he was 
improving.

circumstances...
John turns the page of his newspaper, checks his pocket 
watch, sighs, rings the bell again. 
At last, the door is flung open and a very flustered servant, 
MARY JANE, appears. There’s soot on her cheek and flour all 
over her apron - the worst maid in the world but brimming 
with sass.
JOHN
Where have you been?
MARY JANE
Sorry, sir. I’m rather behind my 
time this morning. 
JOHN
And my breakfast?
COOK (O.S.)
Mary Jane!! Oh my Lord!
Mary Jane casts a forlorn look back towards the kitchen. 
Smoke curls ominously round the door jamb. 
JOHN
This is intolerable. 
MARY JANE
Yes, sir. Sorry sir.
JOHN
Are you incapable of boiling an 
egg? 
Mary Jane just hangs her head. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
The fires are rarely lit, there is 
dust everywhere and you almost 
destroyed my boots scraping the mud 
off them. If it wasn’t my wife’s 
business to deal with the staff, 
I’d talk to you myself -

Where is my wife?

Where did she go?? She’s always out

MARY JANE
Not unlike yourself, sir.
JOHN
I’m sorry?
MARY JANE
Just observing, sir. 
JOHN
That’s quite enough - nobody asked 
you to be observant!
MARY JANE
Sorry, sir. I just meant, you’re 
hardly ever home together any more, 
sir.
JOHN
You are dangerously close to 
impertinence. I shall have a word 
with wife to have a word with you.
MARY JANE
Very good, sir. And when will you 
be seeing her, sir?
JOHN
Now listen -
MARY JANE
Oh, I nearly forgot, sir - a 
telegram came for you.
She passes him a telegram.
JOHN
You forgot?? 
MARY JANE
No, I nearly forgot.

“ABSOLUTE SILENCE.” 
SHERLOCK marches up to the uniformed doorman, WILDER, behind

We move round to reveal the occupier of the chair - a 
colossally fat man. Not just overweight but obese. He’s 
wearing a very well cut but enormous frock-coat with 
pinstripe trousers. A gold watch chain is stretched to 
breaking point over his vast belly. MYCROFT!
MYCROFT
Sherlock. 
He extends a flipper-like hand to John. 
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Dr Watson. 
Mycroft is surrounded by trays and trays of food. Sausages, 
bacon, pies, puddings, steaming soup. He’s like the Ghost of 
Christmas Present, sitting on a pile of nosh. As he speaks, 
he stuffs his fearfully fat face, sweat running down his 
chins.  
JOHN
You look well, sir.
MYCROFT
Really? I rather thought I looked 
enormous.
JOHN
Well now that you mention it, this 
level of consumption is incredibly 
injurious to your health. Your 
heart - 
SHERLOCK
No need to worry on that score, 
Watson. 
JOHN
No?
SHERLOCK
There’s only an empty cavity where 
that organ should reside. 
MYCROFT
It’s a family trait.
SHERLOCK
Oh, I wasn’t being critical.
JOHN
If you continue like this, sir, I

observe. Note the discolouration in 
the whites of my eyes, and the 
visible rings round the corneas.
SHERLOCK
Yes, good point. I’m changing my 
bet to three years, four months and 
eleven days.
JOHN
Bet?!
SHERLOCK
I understand your disapproval, 
Watson - it’s perfectly within his 
power to die early, if he’s feeling 
competitive.
MYCROFT
It’s a risk you’ll have to take.
JOHN
You’re gambling with your own life?
MYCROFT
Why not? It’s so much more exciting 
than gambling with others’.
SHERLOCK
Three years flat if you eat that 
plum pudding!
MYCROFT
Done.
He grabs a huge slab of pudding and stuffs it into his mouth.

MYCROFT
I expected to see you a few days

SHERLOCK
No. I solved it.

MYCROFT
It was Adams, of course. 
SHERLOCK
Yes, it was Adams. 
MYCROFT
Murderous jealousy. He’d written a 
paper for the Royal Astronomical 
Society on the obliquity of the 
ecliptic and then read another that 
seemed to surpass it.
SHERLOCK
I know, I read it.
MYCROFT
Did you understand it?
SHERLOCK
Of course I understood it, it was 
perfectly simple.
A look between Sherlock and John - Sherlock has been caught 
out: he was swotting!
MYCROFT
No, did you understand the 
murderous jealousy? It is no easy 
thing for a great mind to 
contemplate a still greater one ...
Sherlock, furious now.
SHERLOCK
Did you summon me here just to 
humiliate me?
MYCROFT
Yes.
Sherlock looks at him, stonily - gets up.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Of course not, but it is by far the 
greater pleasure. 
SHERLOCK
Then kindly explain what you are -
MYCROFT
Our way of life is under threat 
from an invisibly enemy, one that 
hovers at our elbow on a daily 
basis. These enemies are 
everywhere, undetected and 
unstoppable.

No.
JOHN

MYCROFT
Is there any large body of people 
you’re not concerned about?
SHERLOCK
Dr. Watson is endlessly vigilant. 
Elaborate!
MYCROFT
No. Investigate. This is a 
conjecture of mine - I need you to 
confirm it. I’m sending you a case.
JOHN
The Scots?
SHERLOCK
The Scots!
MYCROFT
Are you aware of recent theories 
concerning what is known as 
paranoia?
JOHN
Sounds Serbian.
MYCROFT
(To Sherlock)
A woman will call on you. Lady 
Louisa Carmichael. I should like 
you to take her case.
JOHN
But these enemies! How are we to 
defeat them if you won’t tell us 
about them?
MYCROFT
We don’t defeat them. We most 
certainly lose to them.

JOHN

MYCROFT
Because they are right. And we are

John: baffled.
SHERLOCK
Lady Carmichael’s case - what is 
it?
MYCROFT
Rest assured - it has features of 
interest.
SHERLOCK
I never really say that.
JOHN
You really do.
SHERLOCK
And you’ve solved it already, have 
you?
MYCROFT
Only in my head. I need you for the 
legwork.
JOHN
But why not tell us your solution?
MYCROFT
Where’s the sport in that? Will you 
do it, Sherlock? I can promise you 
a superior distraction.
Sherlock - tempted, but resentful.
SHERLOCK
... On one condition. Have another 
plum pudding.
MYCROFT
There’s one on the way!
Sherlock springs up, heads for the door. 
SHERLOCK

Thankyou, Wilder.
WILDER
There is also a Mr. Melas to see 
you, Mr. Holmes.
MYCROFT
Give me five minutes - I have a 
wager to win.
He uncovers the tray - revealing three plum puddings. He 
twinkles at Wilder.

Wilder nods and withdraws. Mycroft grabs his spoon with

there too. SERVANTS plonk kedgeree onto their plates as SIR 
EUSTACE slices open his morning correspondence with a letter 
knife.  
SIR EUSTACE
And what does your morning 
threaten, my dear? A vigorous round 
of embroidering? An exhausting 
appointment at the milliners?
LADY CARMICHAEL
I hope you’re teasing, Eustace.
SIR EUSTACE
(laughs)
Of course I am. But heavens knows I 
envy you sometimes, Louisa. No 
cares. No responsibilities...
LADY CARMICHAEL

Simply raising our children, and 
caring for this household.

SIR EUSTACE
Well, exactly -
He stops in his tracks. Sir Eustace has opened a letter and 
is gazing inside the envelope. 
LADY CARMICHAEL
What is it?
He doesn’t reply. But he’s gone white as a sheet. 
LADY CARMICHAEL (CONT’D)
Eustace? 
Still he sits rooted to the spot. Lady Carmichael turns to 
the children.
LADY CARMICHAEL (CONT’D)
Daniel, Sophie. Go out and play. 
SOPHIE
But Mama -
LADY CARMICHAEL
Do as I tell you! Quickly now.
Reluctantly, the children run out of the room, Daniel 
grabbing a couple of slices of toast and stuffing them into 
his mouth. 
Lady Carmichael takes the envelope from her husband’s hand 
and tips it up. Small, dry objects patter into the palm of 
her hand. 
Five orange pips.
She bursts out laughing but then the smile is wiped from her 
face as Sir Eustace turns to her for the first time. 
LADY CARMICHAEL (CONT’D)
Eustace? What does this mean?
SIR EUSTACE
Death.
LADY CARMICHAEL
What?
Suddenly, Sir Eustace plasters a weak smile onto his face. 
SIR EUSTACE
Nothing. It’s nothing. I was 
mistaken.

SIR EUSTACE is at the window, staring out into the night. His 
expression is fixed, eyes wide. 
LADY CARMICHAEL
Eustace?
Sir Eustace emits a low, desperate groan. Lady Carmichael 
jumps out of bed and rushes to his side. 
LADY CARMICHAEL (CONT’D)
Eustace! Are you ill?
Sir Eustace grabs her roughly by the shoulders. She shrieks 
in alarm. 
SIR EUSTACE
She’s come for me, Louisa! Oh God 
help me, my sins have found me out! 
She’s come for me!
LADY CARMICHAEL
Who has come for you? Eustace, 
you’re frightening me -
SIR EUSTACE
Look! Look! 
He drags his wife to the window. She looks out into the 
night. 
Lady Carmichael’s POV: the moonlit garden. Well tended trees, 
bushes. A sundial. A maze.
SIR EUSTACE (CONT’D)
Don’t you see her?
LADY CARMICHAEL
I see no-one! 
SIR EUSTACE
Look, woman, look! 
He presses his face to the glass, eyes wild.

Gone. She’s gone. 
He sinks down, slumped against the wall and starts to sob.

She looks right then left. Which way?
She makes a decision and plunges right.

Keeping close to the hedge, LADY CARMICHAEL strides on. Ahead

Blast it! 
She’s cross now. 
LADY CARMICHAEL (CONT’D)
Eustace! Eustace, it’s me! Where 
are you? Eustace? 
As she peers ahead into the darkness, behind her a white 
figure sweeps past the gap in the hedge. 
The BRIDE!!
It pays no attention to her and is swallowed up by the 
darkness before Lady Carmichael can turn round. But turn 
round she does, aware that something isn’t quite right.

sigh of the wind. 
A woman is singing.
VOICE
“Do not forget me, do not forget 
me! 
Think sometimes of me still; ” 
Lady Carmichael is rooted to the spot by the haunting, 
plaintive sound. 
VOICE (CONT’D)
“When the morn breaks and the  
throstle awakes, Remember the maid  
of the mill....”
She decides to turn back. The song doesn’t seem to get any 
fainter. She races back the way she came, the branches and 
leaves whipping at her face. 
VOICE (CONT’D)
“Do not forget me! do not forget 
me!...”
But she’s lost. Hopelessly lost. She turns - and is 
confronted by blank hedge. Turns again and finds another 
blank hedge. 
She throws herself blindly into the darkness. All the time, 
the song echoes through her head...
VOICE (CONT’D)
“Remember the maid,”
...and suddenly, standing there, staring ahead is Sir 
Eustace. 
Opposite him, her dress grave-begrimed and filthy, her veil 
down, stands the BRIDE. 
BRIDE
(sings)
“the maid of the mill...”
The Bride cocks her head, staring at Lady Carmichael who 
tries to cry out. But all that will come out is a 
strangulated gasp.

She can hardly contain her terror. 
But at last she takes hold of her senses.

Who are you? 
The Bride doesn’t respond. Lady Carmichael grabs her husband 
and swings him round. His face is chalk white. 
LADY CARMICHAEL (CONT’D)
Eustace! Speak to me! In the name 
of God!
She slaps him across the face. Gibbering with fear, he 
finally manages to speak.

She...she is Emelia Ricoletti!
The Bride glides towards them. 
SIR EUSTACE
No. Not you, no, please!
The Bride glides towards them.

This night, Eustace Carmichael, you 
will DIE! 
She puts her filthy gloved hands to her veil, ready to raise 
it. 
Lady Carmichael prepares herself for the sight of the ghostly 
face - but is too much for Sir Eustace, who faints on the 
spot.

You must forgive Watson - he has an

how is your husband this morning?
LADY CARMICHAEL
He refuses to speak about the

to leave the house -
SHERLOCK
No, no, he must stay exactly where 
he is.
LADY CARMICHAEL
You don’t think he’s in danger?
SHERLOCK
Oh, no, someone’s definitely wants 
to kill him  - which is good for 
us, because you can’t set a trap 
without bait.
LADY CARMICHAEL
My husband is not bait, Mr. Holmes.
SHERLOCK
No, but he could be, if we play our

Perhaps since I convinced the

But he won’t follow her, surely?
SHERLOCK
It’s hard to know quite what he 
will do. Guilt is eating away at 
his soul. 
JOHN
Guilt about what?
SHERLOCK
Something in his past. The orange 
pips were a reminder.
JOHN
Not a joke.
SHERLOCK
Not at all. Orange pips are a 
traditional warning of avenging 
death, originating in America. Sir 
Eustace knows that perfectly well -

murder he fears. He believes he is 
to be dragged to hell by the risen 
corpse of the late Mrs Ricoletti.

JOHN
She’s far too good for him.
SHERLOCK
Do you think so?
JOHN
No. You think so. I could tell.
SHERLOCK
On the contrary. I have no view on 
the matter.
JOHN
Yes, you do.

SHERLOCK
Marriage is not a subject upon 
which I dwell.
JOHN
Why not?
SHERLOCK
What’s the matter with you this 
evening?
JOHN
That watch you’re wearing. There’s 
a photograph inside it - I glimpsed 
it once. I believe it is of Irene 
Adler.
SHERLOCK
You didn’t glimpse it - you waited 
till I was asleep and had a look.
JOHN
Yes, I did.
SHERLOCK
You seriously thought I wouldn’t 
notice?
JOHN
Irene Adler.
SHERLOCK
A formidable opponent. A remarkable 
adventure.
JOHN
A very nice photograph.
SHERLOCK
Why are you talking like this??
JOHN
Why are you determined to be alone?
SHERLOCK
... Are you quite well, Watson??
JOHN
Is it such a curious question?
SHERLOCK
From a Viennese alienist, no. From 
a retired Army surgeon, most 
certainly.

JOHN
Holmes! Against absolutely no 
opposition whatsoever, I am your 
closest friend -
SHERLOCK
I concede it.
JOHN
And I am currently attempting to 
have a perfectly normal 
conversation with you -  
SHERLOCK
Please don’t.
JOHN
Why do you need to be alone?
SHERLOCK
If you’re referring to romantic 
entanglement, Watson - which I 
rather fear you are - then as I 
have often explained, all emotion 
is abhorrent to me. It is the grit 
in a sensitive instrument -
JOHN
- the crack in the lens.
SHERLOCK (CONT'D)
- the crack in the lens.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
There you are, I’ve said it all 
before.
JOHN
No. I wrote all that. You’re 
quoting yourself from the Strand 
Magazine.
SHERLOCK
Well, exactly.
JOHN
Those are my words, not yours! 
That’s the version of you I present 
to the public. The brain without a 
heart. The calculating machine. I 
write all that, Holmes, and the 
readers lap it up - but I don’t 
believe it.
SHERLOCK
Well! I’ve a good mind to write to 
your editor.

JOHN
You’re a living, breathing man. 
You’ve lived a life, you have ... a 
past -
SHERLOCK
A what??
JOHN
Well, you must have had - ...
SHERLOCK
Had what?
JOHN
You know.
SHERLOCK
No.
JOHN
... experiences.
SHERLOCK
Pass me your revolver, I have a 
sudden need to use it.
JOHN
Damn it, Holmes, you’re flesh and 
blood. You have feelings, you have 
... you must have ... impulses ...
SHERLOCK
Dear Lord, I have never been so 
impatient to be attacked by a 
murderous ghost.
JOHN
As your friend - as someone who 
worries about you ... what made you 
like this?
On Sherlock now. And the mood has changed. He’s sombre - 
almost haunted.
SHERLOCK
Oh, Watson. Nothing made me.
Suddenly, at the doorway, a soft, persistent scratching 
noise. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I made me.
John turns towards the door. 
Scratch, scratch, scratch...
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

John stares. What is that?
Scratch, scratch, scratch...
Sherlock turns towards the door. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Redbeard?
Suddenly, John grips Sherlock’s arm. 
Sherlock looks up at the window.  
Just visible between the trees, standing with her back 
towards them, looking up at the house is - 
THE BRIDE!!
JOHN
Good God!
John gawps, unable quite to believe what he’s seeing. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
What are we to do?
Sherlock stares. 
SHERLOCK
Why don’t we go and have a chat? 
JOHN
A - ?
But before he can do anything, Sherlock is already at the 
door.

JOHN tumbles after SHERLOCK as he tears from the summer house 
and strides up the drive. 
John’s POV as he runs. The trees are stark black shapes. The 
Bride is occasionally obscured but still there, eerily 
insubstantial as wisps of fog swirl about her. 
SHERLOCK
(cheery)
Mrs Ricoletti, I believe! A very 
pleasant evening for the time of 
year, is it not? 
The Bride does not react. 
He makes to move but John grabs at him.

JOHN
It cannot be true, Holmes! It 
cannot! 
SHERLOCK
No. It can’t.
He moves towards the ghostly shape when - 
SCREEEEEEAAAAM!!
The dying scream of a man from the house! 
Then the unmistakable sound of shattering glass. 
LADY CARMICHAEL (O.S.)
Help me! Help me please!!
Both of them look towards the house. When they look back, the 
Bride has gone. 
SHERLOCK
Come on! 
They race to the house. 
JOHN
Doors all bolted! Damn it!
SHERLOCK
As per instruction. 
JOHN
But that sound - It was a window 
breaking - 
He scans the front of the house. No broken windows. 
SHERLOCK
The only broken window we should 
concern ourselves with - 
Without hesitation, he whips off his coat, wraps it round his 
arm - 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
- is this one!
- and smashes his way inside! John follows.

to be from this side of the house -

floor -

John tenses.

SERVANTS have entered the bedroom. The Housekeeper is 
comforting the sobbing LADY CARMICHAEL as SHERLOCK examines

You promised to keep him safe! You

On Sherlock: grim faced. He lights a bulls-eye lantern and  
tears from the room, following a trail of blood spots.

JOHN is standing by the door-jamb, every muscle tensed. He

JOHN still points the gun, his arm steady. 
JOHN
You’re human, I know that. You must

yourself, hm? 
There’s no reply. 
John glances round. There’s a candle stick right by him.
JOHN (CONT’D)
There’s little sense standing here 
in the dark, is there? This is the 
Nineteenth Century. 
Swiftly, he takes out his match case, strikes one and lights 
the candle. 
The hallway looks a little more cheerful. John sweeps his arm 
round, covering every corner with the pistol. No sign of 
anyone. 
CUT TO:
INT. CARMICHAEL’S HOUSE. UPPER LANDING. NIGHT 3

SHERLOCK has reached the top of the house, almost the attic. 
Suddenly, the beam of his lamp illuminates a crumpled shape.

(CONTINUED)


Sherlock walks up the last few steps towards the small 
landing then reaches out and turns over --
- the body of SIR EUSTACE, eyes fixed open, his face a mask
of absolute horror.
There’s a huge, ornamental dagger sticking out of his chest. 
SCREEEEEAAAAM! 
Sherlock spins round. A young HOUSEMAID has emerged from her 
room and immediately taken in the scene. 
CUT TO:
INT. CARMICHAEL’S HOUSE. HALLWAY. NIGHT 3

JOHN reacts to the scream --
- and the candle flame goes out!
John scrambles about in the darkness. He puts down the candle 
on the floor and tries to strike another match.
One. 
Two.
The third flares into life and he relights the candle.
Something enters the pool of candlelight. The hem of a white 
dress...
John stops dead, full of dread. There’s only the sound of his 
ragged breathing and then -
BRIDE
(sings)
“Do not forget me! do not forget 
me! 
Remember the maid, the maid of the  
mill.” 
John scoops up the candle and sees - 
- the BRIDE!
She reaches out her mottled, rotted, claw-like hands towards 
him!!
John takes to his heels and throws himself onto the stairs. 
He takes them three at a time, all dignity abandoned and 
suddenly -
- slams into SHERLOCK on the stair. John cries out.

JOHN

he steps into the box room.

He gazes towards the shattered window and then turns,

SHERLOCK
Empty, thanks to you. Our bird is 
flown. 
JOHN
No, no, Holmes. It wasn’t what you 
think. I saw her! The ghost! 
SHERLOCK
(Suddenly blazing at him)
There are no ghosts!!!
JOHN
(For a moment, startled by 
the vehemence)
What happened? Where’s Sir Eustace?
SHERLOCK
Dead.

LESTRADE and a uniformed CONSTABLE have arrived. A rug has 
been thrown over the corpse. Sherlock and John in grave 
conversation with Lestrade.
LESTRADE
You really mustn’t blame yourself, 
you know. 
SHERLOCK
No, you’re quite right. 
JOHN
I’m glad you’re seeing sense. 
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

SHERLOCK
Watson here is equally culpable. 
Between us, we’ve managed to botch 
this whole case. 
John sighs. He bends down and throws back the rug to examine 
the body.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I gave an undertaking to protect 
that man and now he’s lying there 
with a dagger in his breast. 
JOHN
In fact, you gave an undertaking to 
investigate his murder -
SHERLOCK
In the confident expectation I 
would not have to!
LESTRADE
Anything you can tell us, doctor?
JOHN
He’s been stabbed with considerable 
force. 
LESTRADE
A man, then?
John looks at Sherlock but he doesn’t respond.
JOHN
Possibly.
LESTRADE
Very keen blade, though. So it 
could conceivably have been a 
woman?
JOHN
In theory. But we know who it was. 
I saw her.
SHERLOCK
Watson!
JOHN
I saw the ghost, with my own eyes!
SHERLOCK
You saw nothing. You saw what you 
were supposed to see. 
JOHN
You said yourself, I have no 
imagination -
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
72.
(CONTINUED)


SHERLOCK
Then use your brain, such as it is. 
Eliminate the impossible - in this 
case, the ghost - and observe what 
remains - in this case a solution 
so blindingly obvious Lestrade 
could work it out.
LESTRADE
Thankyou.
SHERLOCK
Forget spectres from the 
netherworld - there is only one 
suspect, with motive and 
opportunity. They might as well 
have a left note.
LESTRADE
They did leave a note.
SHERLOCK
Then there is the matter of the 
other broken window. 
LESTRADE
What other broken window?
SHERLOCK
Precisely! There isn’t one! The 
only window broken in this 
establishment is the one Watson and 
I entered through. Yet prior to 
that we distinctly heard - 
(Breaks, derailed by 
something)
... what did you say?
LESTRADE
I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK
About a note - what did you say?
LESTRADE
I said the murderer did leave a 
note.
SHERLOCK
No, they didn’t.
LESTRADE
There was a message tied to the 
dagger. You must have seen it?
SHERLOCK
There was no message. 
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15
73.
(CONTINUED)


LESTRADE
Yes -
SHERLOCK
There was no message when I found 
the body!
Lestrade frowns, then produces the dagger from his coat. It’s 
wrapped in a white handkerchief and the blood has seeped 
through. 
Sherlock whips back the handkerchief. There’s a small brown 
rectangle tied to the dagger like a luggage label. 
Sherlock’s face falls. 
JOHN
What is it?
Sherlock walks away, face ashen. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
Holmes?
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

Night, silence, the hiss of the gaslamps.
Sherlock stands at the window, staring out. In the 
foreground, Mycroft is staring at the “Miss Me?” label.
MYCROFT
Do you?
SHERLOCK
Do I what?
For answer Mycroft just holds up the label.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
How did you get that? I left it at 
the crime scene.
MYCROFT
“Crime scene”? Where do you pick up 
these extraordinary expressions. Do
you miss him?
Sherlock frowns, turns back to the window, like he doesn’t 
want to have this conversation.
SHERLOCK
Moriarty’s dead.
MYCROFT
And yet?
SHERLOCK
His body was never recovered.
Mycroft’s gazes move to:
A painting on the wall: Turner’s Reichenbach falls.
MYCROFT
To be expected when one pushes a 
maths professor down a waterfall. 
Pure reason toppled by sheer 
melodrama - your life in a 
nutshell.

SHERLOCK
Where do you pick up these 
extraordinary expressions?
He stares hauntedly at the picture. Blinks -
- because for a fleeting moment, the picture animates, the 
water roars -
Blinks. It stops. Pulls himself together, faces Mycroft.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
... have you put on weight?
MYCROFT
You saw me only yesterday. Does 
that seem possible?
SHERLOCK
No.
MYCROFT
Yet here I am, increased. What does 
that tell the foremost criminal 
investigator in England?
SHERLOCK
In England?
MYCROFT
You’re in deep, Sherlock. Deeper 
than you ever intended to be. Have 
you made a list?
SHERLOCK
Of what?
MYCROFT
Everything. We will need a list.
A silence. Sherlock, clearly uneasy -
- then he plucks a scrap of folded paper from his pocket, 
holds it up. 
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Good boy.
Mycroft puts out his pudgy hand to take it. But Sherlock, 
doesn’t comply - keeps the scrap.
SHERLOCK
No. I’m not finished yet. 
MYCROFT
Moriarty may beg to differ.

SHERLOCK
He’s trying to distract me - derail

MYCROFT
Yes. He’s the crack in the lens, 
the fly in the ointment ...
(A sharp look - making a 
point)
- the virus in the data ...
Sherlock returns that sharp look - that oddly modern 
reference -
- resumes his agitated pacing.
SHERLOCK
I have to finish this!
MYCROFT
If Moriarty has risen from the 
Reichenbach cauldron, he will seek 
you out.
SHERLOCK
I’ll be waiting.
Sherlock striding from the room.
On Mycroft - brooding thoughtful. His eyes flick to the 
painting.
As we hold on his face, we hear the roar of the waters ...

LESTRADE
The press are having a ruddy field

MRS HUDSON
Oh, they’ve been here all the time, 
I can’t get rid of them. I’ve been

LESTRADE
Why do you make them tea?
MRS HUDSON
I don’t know, I just sort of do.
LESTRADE
He says there’s only one suspect,

SHERLOCK is still in the sitting room. 
Silence as he smokes, eyes closed.
Then there’s the slightest creak of a floorboard.
A shadow passes over Sherlock.
Pauses there. Sherlock seems to wince slightly, in distaste - 
as if he feels it. As if it’s clammy.
The shadow passes on.
A stillness for a moment. Then, from off, the familiar voice:
MORIARTY
(From off)
Everything I have to say has 
already crossed your mind.
Closer on Sherlock - those eyes still closed.
SHERLOCK
Then possibly my answer has crossed 
yours.
MORIARTY
Like a bullet!!
Close on Sherlock’s eyes: slo-mo as they snap open, to the 
distant dreamy sound of a gun shot.
Sherlock’s POV. Standing at the window, framed against the 
gaslight - 
- the silhouette of Moriarty.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
It is a dangerous habit to finger 
loaded firearms in the pocket of 
one’s dressing gown ...
Moriarty, stepping forward into the light, demonic.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
... or are you just pleased to see 
me?
Dressed in a respectably sober black frock-coat with a stiff 
Imperial collar, the face is familiar, even though he has a  
neat black beard. His head oscillates from side to side like 
a lizard’s. MORIARTY!

Sherlock smiles.
SHERLOCK
You’ll forgive me taking 
precautions. 
He takes the gun from his pocket, trains it on Moriarty
MORIARTY
I’d be offended if you didn’t - 
obviously I have returned the 
courtesy.
He has plucked a gun from his pockets. He waves it 
negligently, as if it was no more than pen or pointer. As he 
talks he gestures with it - strokes his chin with it, 
scratches his head. As if completely unaware of its deadly 
potential. (Basically, he’s taking the piss out the gun that 
Sherlock has pointed at him.)
He is now strolling about, relaxed, unconcerned.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
I like your rooms, they smell so 
... manly.
SHERLOCK
I’m sure you’ve acquainted yourself 
with them before now.
MORIARTY
Well, you’re always away having 
your little adventures for the 
Strand. Does the illustrator travel 
with you? Do you have to pose 
during your cases? 
SHERLOCK
I’ve been fully aware of the six 
occasions when you have visited 
these apartments, during my 
absence.
MORIARTY
I know. By the way, you have a 
surprisingly comfortable bed.
(Sweeps a finger a long a 
surface, looks at the 
smudge on his finger)
Did you know that dust is largely 
composed of human skin?
SHERLOCK
Yes.

Doesn’t taste the same though.

You want skin fresh. Just a little 
crispy. 
SHERLOCK
Won’t you sit down?
MORIARTY
(Ignoring him)
That’s all people really are, you 
know - dust waiting to be 
distributed. And it gets 
everywhere. In every breath you 
take, dancing in every sunbeam, all 
the used up people.
SHERLOCK
Fascinating, I’m sure but won’t you 
-
Moriarty looks down the barrel of his gun. Blows dust out of 
it.
MORIARTY
People, people, people. You can’t 
keep anything shiny.
He puts his eye to the barrel of the gun, peers right down 
it. Places his thumb on the trigger.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Mind if I fire? Just to clean it 
out?
Sherlock stares at him - what? Then gets it. He tosses the 
gun aside.
- and Moriarty lowers his.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Exactly. Let’s stop playing. We 
don’t need toys to kill each other. 
Where’s the intimacy in that?
SHERLOCK
Sit down. 
MORIARTY
Why? What do you want?
SHERLOCK
You chose to come here -
MORIARTY
Not true - you know that’s not 
true. What do you want??

SHERLOCK
The truth.
MORIARTY
Oh, that!
As he says that word, Moriarty passes a mirror - just for an 
instant, we see him reflected as we usually know him. Neat 
modern suit, slicked back black hair. 
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
(smiles)
Truth’s boring. 
Moriarty now sits opposite Sherlock.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Didn’t expect me to turn up at the 
scene of the crime, did you? Poor 
old Sir Eustace. He got what was 
coming to him.
SHERLOCK
But you couldn’t have killed him.
MORIARTY
So what? Does it matter? Oh, stop 
it. Stop this now. You don’t care 
about Sir Eustace, or the Bride, or 
any of it. There is only one thing 
in this whole business you find 
interesting.
SHERLOCK
I know what you’re doing.
A slight tremor - as if there was the tiniest earthquake. 
Glassware shivers, tinkles. 
MORIARTY
The bride put a gun in her mouth, 
and shot the back of her head off - 
and then she came back. Impossible! 
But she did it. 
The whole room seems to lurch slightly. A few items fall 
over. Neither Sherlock not Moriarty react - what is 
happening??
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
You need to know how. Don’t you?

SHERLOCK
You’re trying to stop. Distract me, 
derail me.
MORIARTY
Because doesn’t this remind you on 
another case? Didn’t this all 
happen before? There’s nothing new 
under the sun!
Sherlock: nothing!
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
What was that case? Do you 
remember? It’s on the tip of my 
tongue.
Tosses the gun in his hand. Looks at it, idly.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
The tip of my tongue ...
He extends his tongue, touches the end of the gun.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
The tip ... of my ... tongue ...
And he slides the gun into his mouth.
Sherlock - keeps it cool.
SHERLOCK
For the sake Mrs Hudson’s 
wallpaper, I’m obliged to remind 
you that one slip of your finger, 
and you’ll be dead.
Moriaty speaks - hmmph mmph mmph. Can’t make it out, cos the 
there’s a gun in his mouth.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I’m sorry?
Hmmph mmmph mph.
Moriarty rolls his eyes, pulls the gun back out of his mouth.
MORIARTY
Dead is the new sexy.
- and he jams the gun back in his mouth, and BLAM!!
Blood explodes over the wall behind him!
And the whole room slants, as if we’re on a banking plane. 
Furniture tumbles. Sherlock barely registers this, like it 
doesn’t matter -

- because he’s staring at -
Moriarty, still just standing there, with slash of blood 
behind him. He takes the gun out of his mouth.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Oh, I tell you what - that blows 
the cobwebs away!
Sherlock, staring, in a thrill of horror.
SHERLOCK
... how can you be alive?
MORIARTY
How do I look?
Horror moment: Moriarty turns his head this way and that - 
and the back of his head is missing!!
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Be honest - is it noticeable?
SHERLOCK
You blew your own brains out - how 
could you survive??
FLASHBACK: sudden, jarring. The Reichenbach Fall, Jim 
Moriarty jamming the gun in his mouth -
MORIARTY
I could back-comb.
SHERLOCK
I saw you die!! Why aren’t you 
dead?? 
FLASHBACK: Sherlock reeling back in horror. Jim lying in a 
pool of his own blood ...
MORIARTY
Because it’s not the fall that 
kills you. 
FLASHBACK: Sherlock on the ledge, spreading his arms, 
preparing to jump -
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Of all people, you should know 
that. It’s never the fall ...
FLASHBACK: Sherlock falling through the air, clawing with his 
hands -
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
It’s the landing.

Disorientated. 
He’s still on the jet from the end of ‘His Last Vow’! 
DIAMOND (30s, pleasant) is beaming down at him. 
DIAMOND
We’ve landed, sir. 
SHERLOCK
What?
DIAMOND
We’ve landed.
SHERLOCK
No! Not now. NOT NOW!!
PILOT(O.S.)
I trust you had a pleasant flight, 
sir?
Sherlock turns. The PILOT is strangely familiar - LADY 
CARMICHAEL!
Sherlock: recovering, looking around, where he really. 
A newspaper lies next to him, opened at a picture of a maze -  
“England’s oldest maze”.

MYCROFT is the first on board. 
MYCROFT
Well, a somewhat shorter exile than 
we’d imagined, brother mine but 
probably adequate given your levels 
of OCD -
SHERLOCK leaps from his seat and grabs him by the lapels. 
SHERLOCK
I’ve got to go back!
MYCROFT
What?
SHERLOCK
Shut up!! Everyone! I nearly had 
it. I was nearly there!
MYCROFT
What on Earth are you talking 
about?
John lays a soothing hand on Sherlock’s arm. 
JOHN
Hey, hey, take it easy. Go back 
where? You didn’t get very far.
SHERLOCK
Ricoletti and his abominable wife! 
Don’t you understand?
MARY
No. Of course we don’t! You’re not 
making any sense, Sherlock. 
Sherlock sinks back into his seat and rubs the balls of his 
palms into his eyes. 
SHERLOCK
A case. A famous case. From a 
hundred years ago.

He taps his head.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Lodged in my hard-drive. She seemed 
to be dead. But she came back. 
JOHN
Like Moriarty? 
SHERLOCK
Shot herself in the head. Exactly
like Moriarty.
MARY
But you’ve only just been told. 
We’ve only just found out! He’s on 
every TV screen in the country -
SHERLOCK
Yes! So? It’s been five minutes 
since Mycroft called. What progress 
have you made? What have you been 
doing?
JOHN
More to the point, what have you 
been doing?
SHERLOCK
I’ve been in my mind palace, of 
course. 
JOHN
Of course. 
SHERLOCK
Running an experiment. How I would 
have solved the case, if I’d been 
around in 1895...
On Mycroft - stony-faced, just looking at him. Something he’s 
not buying here. Not at all. There is an infinite sadness in 
his face.
MYCROFT
Oh, Sherlock ...
Sherlock - visibly agitated now, almost sweaty.
SHERLOCK
I had every detail, perfect. I was 
there! All of it, everything, I was 
immersed.
MYCROFT
Of course you were.
Mary has picked up Sherlock’s phone, is looking at it.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

MARY
You were reading John’s blog - the 
story of how you met ...
SHERLOCK
It helps to see myself through his 
eyes, sometimes - I’m so much 
cleverer.
MYCROFT
Do you really think anyone is 
believing you?
JOHN
No, he can do this, I’ve seen him. 
His Mind Palace, it’s like a whole 
world in his head - ...
SHERLOCK
Yes, and I need to go back there!
MYCROFT
A Mind Palace is a memory 
technique. I know what it can do, 
and I know what it most certainly 
can not.
SHERLOCK
Well maybe there are one or two 
things I know you don’t.
MYCROFT
Oh, there certainly are, little 
brother. Did you make a list?
The question - the same one Dream Mycroft - asked, hits home 
in Sherlock. Something new in his face - little brother 
resentment.
SHERLOCK
You’re putting on weight. Your 
waistcoat is clearly newer than 
your jacket -
MYCROFT
(Flaring)
Stop this, just stop it. Did you 
make a list?
SHERLOCK
Of what??
MYCROFT
Everything, Sherlock. Everything 
you’ve taken.

JOHN
No, it’s not that - he can go into 
a sort of trance, I’ve see him do 
it -
But John breaks off, staring -
- because Sherlock has reached into his coat, and produced a 
folded slip of paper. 
He tosses it at Mycroft’s feet, turns away.
John, so wounded.
Mycroft, calmly picking up the paper.
MYCROFT
We have an agreement, my brother 
and I, ever since...that day.
Flashback.
Everything blurred, shifted, out of focus. 
CLOSE on a stick thin, pale young man, writhing in agony. A 
17 year old Sherlock. 
MYCROFT (V.O.)
Wherever I find him, in whatever 
back alley, or doss house, there 
will always be a list.
CUT TO:
JOHN has snatched the list from him.
JOHN
He couldn’t have taken all that in 
five minutes.
MYCROFT
He was high before he got on the 
plane.
MARY
Didn’t seem high.
On Mary: she is now in the of seats, on her phone, rapidly 
typing away.
MYCROFT
Nobody deceives like an addict. 
A beat as Mycroft notices Mary is working away.

SHERLOCK
I’m not an addict, I’m a user. I 
alleviate boredom, occasionally I 
enhance my mental processes -
JOHN
For God’s sake. This could kill 
you. You could die!
SHERLOCK
Controlled usage is not usually 
fatal - and abstinence is not 
immortality.
MYCROFT
(To Mary)
What are you doing?
MARY
Emelia Ricoletti - looking her up.
MYCROFT
Oh, I suppose we should. I have 
access to the top level of the MI5
archive, we could always -
MARY
Yeah, that’s where I’m looking.
MYCROFT
(Icy)
... What do think of MI5 security?
MARY
I think it would be a good idea. 
(Hands him the phone)
Emelia Ricoletti - unsolved, like 
he says.
Sherlock is seating himself at the back of the plane, as if 
ready to meditate.
SHERLOCK
Could you all shut up a minute - I 
have to go back. I nearly had it, 
before you all came in and started 
yapping.
JOHN
Yapping?? Sorry, were we 
interrupting your bender??
Mycroft, pushes past him. Focussed on Sherlock. Serious now, 
even compassionate.
MYCROFT

SHERLOCK
No, it’ll only encourage you.
MYCROFT
I’m not angry with you.

Well that’s a relief, I was really 
worried. No, hang on, I really 
wasn’t.
MYCROFT
(completely sincere)
I was there for you before. I’ll be 
there for you again. I’ll always be 
there for you. 
Flashback. 
A horrible, featureless room. SHERLOCK on the bed, strung 
out, silent howling. 
By his side, a well-dressed man in his early 20s. Mycroft. 
CUT TO:
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
This was my fault.
SHERLOCK
It was nothing to do with you.
MYCROFT
A week in a prison cell - I should 
have realised.
SHERLOCK
Should’ve realised what?
MYCROFT
That in your case, solitary 
confinement is locking you up with 
your worst enemy.
SHERLOCK
Oh for God’s sake -
JOHN

Morphine or cocaine?
Sherlock looks in confusion.
SHERLOCK
What did you say?
JOHN
I didn’t say anything?

SHERLOCK
Yes, you did, you said -
And now we hear John’s voice again, but John is clearly not 
speaking.
JOHN

Which is it today - morphine or 
cocaine?
Sherlock, bewildered for a moment - clearly no one else can 
hear this -

Close on Victorian Holmes - just as his eyes snap open!
Wider. Sherlock is sprawled on his divan of cushions. Looks 
around, orientating himself. 
There’s the neat morocco case - opened and empty. 
There’s the hypodermic - used and discarded.
And there’s Victorian John, standing just inside the door -
- and he’s in a towering rage. He slams the door like a 
thunderclap. Every trace of Nigel Bruce is gone - this man is 
an angry soldier.
JOHN
Answer me, damn it!
Sherlock: confused, blinking.
SHERLOCK
... Moriarty was here.
JOHN
Moriarty’s dead.
SHERLOCK
I was ... I was on a jet ...
JOHN

SHERLOCK
You were there. Mycroft ...
JOHN
You haven’t left these rooms, 
Holmes. You haven’t moved. Now tell 
me - Morphine or Cocaine?
On Sherlock: pulling himself together. Now rising -
SHERLOCK
Cocaine. A seven percent solution, 
would you care to try it?
JOHN
No, but I’d quite like to find 
every ounce of the stuff in your 
possession and pour it out of the 
window.
SHERLOCK
I should be inclined to stop you.
JOHN
Then you would be reminded, quite 
forcibly, which of us is a soldier, 
and which of us is a drug addict.
SHERLOCK
You’re not a soldier, you’re a 
doctor.
JOHN
An army doctor - which means I 
could break every bone in your body 
while naming them!!
SHERLOCK
My dear Watson, you are allowing 
emotion to cloud your judgement. 
JOHN
Never on a case - you promised me, 
never on a case!
SHERLOCK
No, I just said that in one of your 
stories.
JOHN
Listen. I’m happy to play the fool 
for you. I will run along behind 
you, like a half-witted puppy, 
making you look clever, if that’s 
what you need - but dear God above, 
you will hold yourself to a higher 
standard.

Yes. Because of my idiot stories!

The door flies open - BILLY, the page boy.
BILLY (CONT’D)
Mr Holmes! Telegram, Mr Holmes!
SHERLOCK tears it open. Pales.
WATSON
What is it? What’s wrong?
SHERLOCK
It’s Mary. 
JOHN
Mary?? What about her?
Sherlock looks at him - manner totally different now. 
Suddenly haggard with worry.
SHERLOCK
It is entirely possible that she’s 
in danger. 
JOHN
Danger??
SHERLOCK
There’s not a moment to lose.
JOHN
Is this the cocaine talking? What 
danger could Mary be in? I’m sure 
she’s just visiting friends.
Sherlock, throwing aside his dressing gown, pulling on his 
coat -

Sherlock and John, clattering down the stairs.

But what’s going on?? Are you even

SHERLOCK
For Mary, of course I am! Never

But as reaches to take his topper from the hatstand, he 
gasps, staggers against the wall -
JOHN
Holmes.
SHERLOCK
I’m fine. I’m fine.
John looks at him - disgusted, but he has to find a way to 
help him. He grabs, the topper from his hand, tosses it.
JOHN
Not that one -

Good old Watson! How would we fill 
the time if you didn’t ask 
questions!
JOHN
Sherlock, tell me where my bloody 
wife is, you pompous prick or I’ll 
punch your lights out!
Sherlock looks at him in astonishment - 
- for a moment, as the street flick past, he is looking at 
Modern John - then a flick of shadow and the moustache is 
back.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Holmes? Where is she?
SHERLOCK
A de-sanctified church. She thinks 
she’s found the solution, and for 
no better reason than that, has put 
herself in the path of considerable 
danger. What an excellent choice of 
wife.
He cracks the whip.

Moonlight pours through a high shattered stained-glass 
window, throwing coloured shapes over the stone floor.
SHERLOCK and JOHN enter. 
From somewhere in the church, they can hear a soft 
susurration, a murmuring. Voices, in unison. Chanting?
They exchange a look. John takes out his revolver and cocks 
it.
They creep past a pew. Suddenly, MARY steps out. 
JOHN
What the devil - ?

She takes John’s hand and leads him down - down - down a 
spiral staircase into the vault below. Sherlock follows.

He opens the door with a soft click. Flame-red light spills 
out into the vault. They look down onto -

- a vision from Hell! A massive, Dennis Wheatley-like Satanic
sabbath. The crypt is packed with ACOLYTES, all swathed in

There’s a stone altar at this end of the room and tall black 
candles sputter and flicker on it. 
Gently, Sherlock closes the door.

And what the devil are you doing

MARY
I’ve been making enquiries - Mr. 
Holmes asked me.
JOHN
Holmes - how could you??
MARY
No, not him - the clever one. It 
seemed obvious to me that this 
business couldn’t have been managed 
alone. My theory is that Mrs 
Ricoletti had help. Help from her 
friends. 
SHERLOCK
Bravo, Mary. 
(A beat)
The clever one??
JOHN
I...I thought I was losing you. I 
thought perhaps, we were neglecting 
each other.
SHERLOCK
Well you’re the one who moved out.
JOHN
I was talking to Mary. You’re 
working for Mycroft??
MARY
He likes to keep an eye on his mad 
little brother.
SHERLOCK
And he had a spy to hand. Has it 
never occurred to you that your 
wife’s skills are rather excessive 
for a nurse.
MARY
Of course it didn’t - because he 
knows what a nurse is capable of! 
When did it occur to you?

A flight of stone steps leads down into the crypt. The whole

The purple-robed acolytes have formed two massive columns on 
either side of the room. They chant an obscure and obsessive 
dirge.
In the corner of the room is a huge gong -
- and suddenly it’s rung!
SHERLOCK, JOHN and MARY have descended the steps into the 
room. 
The chanting abruptly cuts out as the sound of the booming 
gong resonates through the crypt. All the hooded figures turn 
their heads towards him. 
Sherlock sounds the gong again.
The crowd, turning, staring. 
SHERLOCK
Sorry. I can never resist a gong. 
Or a touch of the dramatic.

Never have guessed!

Excellent. Superlative theatre. I

He walks into the midst of the acolytes. They part before 
him.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself, 
then, apparently, returned from the

How was it done?
Silence from the acolytes.

In the window, dressed in her bridal gown is MRS RICOLETTI,

Mrs Ricoletti gets everyone’s 
attention in very efficient 
fashion. 
THE BRIDE
You...or me.
The Bride grins diabolically down at ALF in the street. Now 
takes the revolver, places the muzzle in her mouth.
She stares down with mad, glittering eyes -

- and winks.
Blam! She fires the gun and falls backwards. A torrent of 
blood splashes across the curtains. But it’s come from - 
- a bucket in the hands of a WOMAN IN BLACK (we only see her 
from behind) 
Mrs Ricoletti crawls swiftly across the carpet and out of the 
far door of the bedroom. Two other WOMEN step through the 
door carrying a body in an identical wedding dress. 
SHERLOCK
The substitute corpse bears a 
strong resemblance to Mrs Ricoletti 
but once a gun has been placed in 
its mouth -
Blam!
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)

detailed identification just yet.
Meanwhile...

The BRIDE levels her shotgun at her husband. 
She lifts her veil with one hand, revealing MRS RICOLETTI.
RICOLETTI
E...Emelia?
DRIVER

Christ preserve us. 
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
A perfect, positive identification. 
The late Mrs Ricoletti has returned 
from the grave and - 
BOOOOM!
Ricoletti is flung back into the Thames. 
Constable RANCE moves towards the Bride.
RANCE
Now look here, miss. Everything 
will be alright. But I think you’d 
better come with me --
She turns, walks away. The back of her head a mess of 
compacted blood and gore. 
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
A little skilled make-up and you 
have nothing less than the wrath of 
a vengeful ghost...
Ashen-faced, Rance pulls out his whistle and blasts on it. 
The Bride walks into the dense fog. 
Suddenly, a man-hole cover opens up before her and another 
WOMAN IN BLACK appears, clinging to a sewer-ladder. She helps 
the Bride clamber down. In an instant, the cover is replaced, 
just as Rance races across it, looking scared and bewildered.

CUT TO:
INT. BARE ROOM. DAWN 1A FLASHBACK

A neat, white bed in a small bare room, lit by gas-jets. MRS 
RICOLETTI is saying goodbye. She kisses each and every one of 
the large group of women who surround her. 
Then she lays down on the bed. 
A WOMAN stands by her. She’s holding a revolver. 
MRS RICOLETTI
Swiftly now. No tears. 
The Woman steels herself, places the gun in Mrs Ricoletti’s 
mouth and -
BANG!
CUT TO:

SHERLOCK
After that, it was merely a 
question of substituting the real 
Mrs Ricoletti for the corpse in the 
morgue. This time, should anyone 
attempt to identify her, it would 
be positively, absolutely her. 
Mary removes her hood. 
MARY
But why would she do that? Die to 
prove a point?
SHERLOCK
Every great cause has martyrs. 
Every war has suicide missions. And 
make no mistake, this is war. One 
half of the human race at war with 
the other. The invisible army,

Now all the hoods are being lowered - and now we see that 
they are all women. Every one of them.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
But an army nonetheless, ready to 
rise in the best of causes - to put  
right an injustice as old as 
humanity itself.
(To John)
You see, Watson - Mycroft was 
right. This is a war we must lose.
JOHN
She was dying. 
SHERLOCK
Who was?
JOHN
Emilia Ricoletti. There were clear 
signs of Consumption. I doubt she 
was long for this world.
SHERLOCK
So she decided to make her death 
count. She already knew of the 
secret societies of America. She 
was able to draw on their methods 
of intimidation and fear to 
publicly - very publicly - confront 
Sir Eustace Carmichael with the 
sins of his past. 
A voice rings out. One that we might recognise:
MOLLY
He knew her out in the States. 
Promised her everything. Marriage. 
Position. 
Stepping forward from the crowd - MOLLY HOOPER!
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Then he had his way with her - and 
threw her over. Left her abandoned 
and penniless. 
SHERLOCK
Hooper!
MOLLY
Holmes! 
JOHN
For the record, Holmes - she didn’t 
have me fooled.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

(CONTINUED)


His moment of smugness is cut off when he notices among the 
crowd -
- his own maid, Mary Jane. She gives me a little wave.
The next acolyte steps forward. It’s Janine, from His Last 
Vow.
JANINE
Emelia thought she’d found 
happiness with Ricoletti but... He 
was a brute too. 
She turns to Sherlock, her face set with passion. 
JANINE (CONT’D)
Emelia Ricoletti was our friend. 
You have no idea how that bastard 
treated her. 
JOHN
But the Bride, Holmes! We saw her! 
SHERLOCK
We did, Watson. But that breaking 
glass we heard? Not a window. Just 
an old theatrical trick...
CUT TO:
EXT. CARMICHAEL’S HOUSE. NIGHT 3.

95A
In an archway by the side of Carmichael’s house - an angled 
sheet of glass, a bright, blazing light and the very solid 
and real figure of THE BRIDE. She steps into the light and is 
reflected in the glass. Immediately, a ghostly image appears 
in the fog some way off.
We see SHERLOCK and JOHN run towards the ghostly image. 
From the house, the sound of Sir Eustace’s scream. 
The Bride backs out of the light and ‘disappears’. Two black-
clothed WOMEN appear from the shadows and start to move the 
pane of glass. It wobbles violently - and suddenly shatters. 
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
It didn’t really matter that the 
trick went a little wrong.

SHERLOCK
Once the idea exists, then it 
cannot be killed.
He tails off. A stone door has creaked open in the far wall 
and a figure steps out into the hellish red glow -
THE BRIDE!
Veiled and still wearing the ghastly, stained wedding dress, 
she makes her way down the ‘aisle’ formed by the rows of 
acolytes, like some nightmarish parody of the wedding 
service. The Bride takes her place by Sherlock by the altar: 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
This is the work of a single minded 
person. Someone who knew first hand 
about Sir Eustace’s mental cruelty. 
The dark secret kept from all but 
her closest friends. Including 
Emelia Ricoletti. The woman her 
husband had wronged all those years 
before. If one disregards the 
ghost, there is only one suspect, 
isn’t there ...
He turns to face the Bride.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
...Lady Carmichael? 
... but, silence. 
The veil, impenetrable.
The ghost of a frown on Sherlock’s face - like this isn’t 
going the way he expected.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
One small detail doesn’t quite make 
sense to me, however.

Why did you engage me to prevent a 
murder you intended to commit?
Silence. The veil...
Then ... a soft, Irish chuckle.
Sherlock: a reeling, shifting moment - this isn’t right, this 
is so, so wrong!
Then, from behind the veil, the voice of ...
MORIARTY
“Doesn’t quite make sense!” Of 
course it doesn’t make sense!
And now he raises the veil - the face of Moriarty!
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Peek-a-boo.
Sherlock, now reeling back.
SHERLOCK
No, no! Not you - it can’t be you!
MORIARTY
I mean, come on, be serious! The 
costumes?? The gong?? Speaking as a 
criminal mastermind, we don’t 
really have gongs and special 
outfits.
And John and Mary, watching, astonished.
JOHN
What the hell is going on??
MORIARTY
Is it silly enough for you yet. 
Gothic enough? Mad enough even for 
you?? It doesn’t make sense, 
Sherlock, because it’s not real!!
None of it!
An now light blazes in the room, momentarily blinding 
Sherlock - he falls to knees.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
This is all in your mind.
JOHN
Holmes? What’s he talking about?
Sherlock looks fuzzily round at them. He’s sweating, 
desperate.

JOHN (CONT’D)
Sherlock?
The light pulses. They’re back to Victorian.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Holmes?
MORIARTY
Dreaming, Sherlock - big bad dream 
and you’re never getting out.
Sherlock pounds his fist on the floor.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Did you hear the story of Sherlock 
Holmes? His head grew so big he 
lost himself inside it.
The light pulsing again, dazzling. 
SHERLOCK
I have to wake. This isn’t real, I 
need to wake up.
Moriarty now pushes his face at Sherlock.
MORIARTY
No, Sherlock, you need to dream. 
Dream and dream, Sherlock. Dream 
with me!
And the light blazes again, this time becoming a white 
screen.
We hear a voice.
MARY

MYCROFT (O.S.)

Sherlock looks over. He’s lying on top of a hospital bed, 
fully clothed. A DOCTOR is shining the light in his eye. 
MYCROFT is sitting by the bed, smiling. 
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
May I just check - is this what you 
mean by controlled usage?
Sherlock sits up. 
SHERLOCK
Mrs Emelia Ricoletti. I need to 
know where she was buried! 
MYCROFT
In 1895?
SHERLOCK
Yes!
MYCROFT
Oh come on. It would take months to 
find. If those record even exist. 
Even with my resources, it’s beyond 
feasibility -
MARY
Got it!
Pan to Mary - she’s back on her phone.

The cemetery, in splendid gothic decay.
A couple of police cars screech to a halt outside. The door

him, JOHN, MARY, MYCROFT, LESTRADE. 
JOHN
I don’t get it. How is this 
relevant?
SHERLOCK
I just need to know I was right. 
Then I’ll be sure. 
MARY
You mean how Moriarty did it?

SHERLOCK
Yes. 
JOHN
But none of that really happened - 
it was in your head.
SHERLOCK
My investigation was the fantasy - 
the crime happened exactly as I 
described.
MYCROFT
This is the spot. The stone was

SHERLOCK, JOHN, MYCROFT, LESTRADE and MARY gaze down at an 
ancient, unloved grave. On the stone, faded letters -
EMELIA RICOLETTI. ‘BELOVED SISTER - FAITHFUL BEYOND DEATH’. 
SHERLOCK
Mrs Ricoletti was buried here. But 
what happened to the other one? The 
corpse they substituted for her 
after the so-called suicide? 
JOHN
They’d get rid of it. Of course 
they would.
SHERLOCK
But where?
JOHN
Well, not here. 
SHERLOCK
But that’s exactly what must have 
happened. The conspirators had 
someone on the inside. They found a 
body just like Molly Hooper found 
one for me when I...
John shoots him a look. Still a sore point.

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Yes, well, there’s no need to go

Are you seriously going to do this.
SHERLOCK
It’s why we came here. I need to 
know.
JOHN
Oh, spoken like an addict.
SHERLOCK
This is important to me!!
JOHN
No, this is you needing a fix.  
SHERLOCK
John -
JOHN
Moriarty’s back - we have a case, 
we have a real live problem right 
now ... !
SHERLOCK
Getting to that! Very next thing on 
the list! Just let me do this.
JOHN
Everyone lets you do everything you 
want, that’s how you got in this 
state. 
SHERLOCK
John, please -
JOHN
Not this time, not playing. 
When you’re ready to get to work, 
give me a call. I’m taking Mary

Mary’s taking me home.
MARY

John takes Mary’s arm, off they go. Mycroft looks mildly at 
Sherlock.
MYCROFT
He’s right, you know.
SHERLOCK
So what, he’s right. He’s always 
right, it’s boring. Will you help 
me??
He looks to the pair of them. Mycroft and Lestrade exchange a 
glance. Oh God! Mycroft shrugs
MYCROFT
Cherchez la femme.

LATER
Night has fallen. By the lights of powerful torches, SHERLOCK 
and LESTRADE have taken over digging duties. They’re down 
deep now. MYCROFT - naturally - stands above, holding the 
torch.
LESTRADE’s spade strikes something hard. He looks up 
SHERLOCK.
CUT TO:
A horrible, rending screech as LESTRADE pulls open the 
ancient coffin lid. 
MYCROFT points the beam of his torch into the grave.
SHOCK ECU!! - the appalling, desiccated features of EMELIA 
RICOLETTI, in her ancient, rotted wedding gown. The eyes are 
blank, black sockets, writhing with worms, the nose has been 
eaten away. The mouth is a gaping, slimy black maw. Her 
skeletal arms are crossed over her rib-cage. 
CUT TO:
Faces contorted in disgust, SHERLOCK and LESTRADE heave the 
coffin onto the ground by the grave. Inside the coffin, one 
the Bride’s crossed arms falls to its side. 
MYCROFT points his torch into the coffin. There’s a torn, 
stained, horrible silk lining - nothing else.
MYCROFT
Oh dear. The cupboard is bare. 
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

He jumps into the grave, scrabbling at the black soil 
beneath.
Down.
Down. 
Down. 
But there’s nothing there.
LESTRADE
Bad luck, Sherlock. Maybe they got 
rid of the body some other way.
MYCROFT
More than likely. In any event, it 
was a very long time ago. We do 
have slightly more pressing 
matters, little brother.
(A meaningful look)
Moriarty, back from the dead.
On the word “dead” -
In the light of the torch beams we can see the skeleton of 
Mrs Ricoletti. Unnoticed by all of them, its arm moves back 
over its chest!
Sherlock nods, defeated. Lestrade puts out his hand and pulls 
Sherlock out of the grave.
As he scrambles up, they all freeze. From out of the black 
night, someone is singing. A lungless, cracked, horrible 
breathy --
“Do not forget me! do not forget 
me! 
Remember the maid, the maid of the  
mill.” 
John points his torch towards Sherlock’s ankle. There’s a 
rotten, skeletal hand clamped around it! And, rising up 
behind Sherlock - 
THE BRIDE!
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

The decayed veil flutters in a supernatural wind. The black 
maw of a mouth drops open.
And the Bride screeeeeeeams!
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Oh my - !
LESTRADE
Jesus!
Sherlock yells as the skeletal arms clutch at him, embrace 
him.
MYCROFT
Get it off! Get it off him!
LESTRADE
Sherlock - hang on - 
But the Bride’s grip is remorseless. Sherlock claws at the 
corpse but it’s embrace is like iron.
Soon he is face to face with her. He blanches in pure panic 
as the great slavering maw comes closer and closer as if to 
kiss him. And then --

EXT. PATHWAY. NIGHT 7

SHERLOCK blinks awake. 
He’s lying on a muddy pathway. There’s a deafening noise all 
around and he’s wet with spray. 
He shakes his head, tries to orientate himself. 
He seems to be on the rocky edge of a cliff. He drags himself 
to his feet, looks down - and almost swoons. 
Tumbling far, far below him is a colossal, thundering 
waterfall! 
A sixth sense tells him to turn and he sees, silhouetted at 
the end of the pathway, the somewhat sinister figure of 
MORIARTY. 
SHERLOCK
Oh, I see. Still not awake, am I? 
MORIARTY
The first time you woke up was 
real. But not the hospital and the 
grave! You’re still ODing on the 
plane. Too deep, Sherlock. Way, way 
too deep.

MORIARTY
You know what I am. I’m Moriarty. 
The Napoleon of Crime.
SHERLOCK
Moriarty’s dead.
MORIARTY
Not in your mind. I’ll never be 
dead there. I’m every doubt you’ve 
ever had, Sherlock. Every bad day. 
Worming away inside that brilliant 
brain of yours. Don’t you see? Even 
if I only survive as an idea, I’ll 
have beaten you. I’ll always beat 
you. You once called your brain a 
hard drive. Well say hello to the 
virus.
CLOSE on Sherlock. A moment of realisation.  
SHERLOCK
That’s how you did it.
MORIARTY

SHERLOCK
You want to finish this? 
He takes a sombre pace forward.
MORIARTY
This is how we end, you and I. 
Always here, always together.
He takes a pace forward too.
SHERLOCK
You have a magnificent brain, 
Moriarty. I admire it. I conceded 
it may even be the equal of my own.
Pace.
MORIARTY
I’m touched. I’m honoured.
Pace. Almost face to face.
SHERLOCK
But when it comes to the matter of 
unarmed combat on the edge of a 
precipice ...
(Looming over Moriarty, he 
now stoops to look right 
into his face - and 
modern Sherlock bares his 
teeth)
... you’re going in the water, 
short-arse.
Moriarty grins up at him, delighted -
- and then his face falls into a fearful mask of hatred. His 
head oscialltes from side to side - 
- and he throws himself at Sherlock!
They grapple. Moriarty’s fingers squeeze at Sherlock’s face. 
Sherlock manages to bring up his knee into Moriarty’s 
stomach. Moriarty lurches, winded, then swings round his fist 
and slams it into Sherlock’s chin.
Sherlock falls back onto the slippery ledge - as shocked as 
he is winded -
MORIARTY
You’re big and strong, Sherlock. 
But not with me.
SHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15

(CONTINUED)


The rain is falling heavily and Sherlock slips on the filthy 
black soil as he struggles to get up. 
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
I am your weakness.
Moriarty charges him again. Sherlock swings a fist - and 
misses. Moriarty head-buts him and Sherlock goes down again. 
He slides through the mud, closer to the edge of the 
waterfall.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
I keep you down. 
And Moriarty’s on him. Punches him again, again, again.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
When you stumble, when you fail ... 
every time you’re weak - I am 
there!
He’s yanked the dazed Sherlock half to his feet. His arms now 
wrapped around him from behind, he swings Sherlock round to 
look out over the falls.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
I make you fall.
Sherlock tries to struggle - but Moriarty’s grip is vice-
like.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
No, no, baby, stop that, hush.
(Almost nuzzling into him)
Don’t fight it. Lie back and lose, 
it’s so relaxing. 
Sherlock, blinking, disorientated.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Oh, are all those funny little 
chemicals fizzing your brain again. 
Here, let me splash some water on 
your face.
He shuffles him closer to the edge. Weak as a kitten, 
Sherlock tries to resist.
MORIARTY (CONT’D)
Shall we go over together? Are you 
read to say wheee? It has to be 
together, doesn’t it. At the end, 
it’s always just you and me.
From off, a throat is cleared.
Moriarty: what??

The click of a gun being cocked.
From off:
JOHN
Professor, if you wouldn’t mind 
stepping away from my friend - I do 
believe he finds your attention a 
shade annoying. 
Moriarty looks round in astonishment.
There’s John Watson on the ledge, his gun levelled right at 
him.
MORIARTY
Oh, that’s not fair. There’s two of 
you.
JOHN
There’s always two of us. Don’t you 
read The Strand?
Moriarty has stepped away from Sherlock, who now scrambles 
up.
JOHN (CONT’D)
On your knees, Professor. Hands 
behind your head.
Moriarty complies.
SHERLOCK
Thank you, John.
JOHN
Since when do you call me John??
SHERLOCK
You’d be surprised.
JOHN
Actually, I really wouldn’t. Time 
you woke up, Sherlock.
Sherlock at him surprise. John just smiles.
JOHN (CONT’D)
I’m a story teller. I know when I’m 
in one.
Sherlock smiles. Always underestimates him.

for God’s sake?
JOHN
Annoying.
SHERLOCK
Offensive.
JOHN
Actually, would you mind?
SHERLOCK
Not at all.
John steps casually forward -
- and kicks Moriarty hard. Moriarty flails, screams, and 
plunges, disappearing down into the torrent.
JOHN
It was my turn. 
SHERLOCK
Quite so.
Beat. 
JOHN
So how do you plan to wake up?
SHERLOCK
Oh, I should think, like this.
Sherlock steps to the ledge, spreads his arms, just as he did 
in The Reichenbach Fall.

Sherlock is deathly pale, sweating. 
Sherlock passes a hand over his eyes. It was a close run

He smiles up at his friends.
SHERLOCK
Miss me?
JOHN
Sherlock? Are you all right?
He’s sitting up, groggy, but pulling himself together.
SHERLOCK
Of course I’m all right. Why 
wouldn’t I be all right?
MARY
Because you probably just OD’d. You 
should be in a hospital.
SHERLOCK
There isn’t time. Baker Street, now

He’s on his feet -

A moment. 
Sherlock takes the list - and tears it in half, tosses it 
away.
SHERLOCK
No need for that. I’ve got the real 
thing now. I’ve got work to do.
But Mycroft, not budging, so serious. Haunted, worlds 
unspoken.
MYCROFT
Sherlock ... promise me.
SHERLOCK
Why are you still here. Shouldn’t 
you be off arranging me a pardon, 
or something? Like a proper big 
brother?
He pushes past, strides. 
A moment. Mycroft kneels, carefully retrieves the torn list, 
preserving the pieces.
As Mary and John move to follow Sherlock -
MYCROFT
Dr. Watson ...
John turns. Mycroft, kneeling on the floor, torn list in 
hand. Never looked more vulnerable.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Look after him. Please.
A beat on John. A stiff little nod. And he and Mary go.
We hold on Mycroft, as he slips the torn pieces into a slim 
notebook he has retrieved from his jacket. It is a fairly old 
notebook, packed with Mycroft’s handwriting.
We glimpse a page of notes, headed with the single word: 
Readbeard -
- before he snaps the notebook shut!
(If we can make this seem to be the same notebook Mycroft had 
in A Study In Pink - in his first meeting with John - so much

Army’? ‘The League of Furies’? ‘The 
Monstrous Regiment’?
JOHN
I rather thought...’The Abominable 
Bride’.
Beat.
SHERLOCK
A trifle lurid. 
JOHN
It’ll sell. It’s got proper murders 
in it too!
SHERLOCK
(smiles)
You’re the expert.
JOHN
As for your own tale...You’re sure 
it’s still just a seven percent 
solution that you take? I think you 
might have increased the dosage.

SHERLOCK
Well perhaps I’m being fanciful. 
But perhaps such things could come 
to pass. And I know I would be very 
much at home in such a world.
JOHN
I don’t think I would be.
SHERLOCK
I beg to differ.
Sherlock has stood up, strolled to the window. He looks out 
over Baker Street.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
But then, I have always known I was 
a man out of his time.
CUT TO:
EXT. BAKER STREET. NIGHT 8

-- we’re on the outside of the window, looking in. Victorian 
Sherlock, looking out at his world -
- but as we pull back, we see -
- modern Baker Street! Traffic, pedestrians, all of modern 
London crowds the screen, framing the Victorian Sherlock 
Holmes.
Our show in a nutshell!
END TITLES.
