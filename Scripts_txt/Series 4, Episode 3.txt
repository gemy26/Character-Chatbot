INT. PLANE - NIGHT
1
1
Very close on an eye - a child’s eye, closed, sleeping.
Light and shade are flickering across the closed lid. There 
is a jostling of motion.
Now the eye is fluttering open.
The eye, blinking sleepily. Then staring. Now the eye 
widening in shock, the pupil expanding.
Child’s POV.
The airplane window, right next to her  The plane is 
juddering, shaking - perfectly ordinary turbulence. Outside, 
stars, the sea far below. 
Wider on the child - a LITTLE GIRL - blinking properly 
awake.. 
Looks round to her mother.
THE GIRL
Mummy?
Looks round the plane. The cabin lights are dimmed, everyone 
is sleeping.
The Girl’s eyes widening, because -
- hanging in front of every passenger, untouched, are the 
oxygen masks. They sway eerily in the semi-darkness as the 
plane judders and jolts.
THE GIRL (CONT’D)
Mummy!
She pulls at her Mother’s arm -
- and her Mother lolls against her. Stertorous breathing. Not 
just asleep, profoundly unconscious.
THE GIRL (CONT’D)
Mummy, wake up. Wake up!!
Nothing, no response -
- the plane lurches, buffets -
THE GIRL (CONT’D)
Mummy!
And then, incongruously -
- the sound of a mobile phone ringing.
The Girl - what??


Somewhere on the plane a mobile phone is ringing. Confused, 
panicking, trying to locate the noise.
- the girl’s eye is drawn to -
- in the aisle, a stewardess sprawls unconscious. Her body
rolls as the plane shakes and shudders again -
- now panning along the aisle, to the door to the cockpit. It 
is flapping open, and through it we can see -
- the pilot, slumped sideways out of his chair. 
THE GIRL (CONT’D)
Wake up! Please, mister, wake up!
- and the phones keep ringing -
The Girl: unbuckling her seatbelt. Now climbing past her 
mother. 
She starts heading down the lurching aisle, grabbing the 
seatbacks to steady herself, picking her way over the 
sprawled stewardess, heading towards the cockpit ...
The plane judders and lurches, she’s flung hard against one 
of the sleeping passengers -
- that phone ringing - close now, where is it, where is it? 
Ah! She can see the light of the phone screen glowing through 
the netted pouch on the seat back.
She reaches for the phone, pulls it out, clicks it on.
THE GIRL (CONT’D)
Help me! Please, I’m on a plane, 
and everyone’s asleep, help me!!
A familiar voice.
MORIARTY
Hello. My name’s Jim Moriarty. 
Welcome to the final problem!

THE OPENING TITLES
OLD MOVIE

A black and white film fills the screen. 
It’s a 1940s American Noir. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
2.


A rugged, uniformed COP (LEONARD) and a VOLUPTUOUS WOMAN 
(VELMA) with hair like Veronica Lake’s are standing a little 
too close to each other. 
LEONARD
You know I could arrest you.
VELMA
What for?
LEONARD
Wearing a dress like that.
VELMA
Would you like me to take it off?
LEONARD
Then I’d really have to press 
charges. 
VELMA
Press away. 
LEONARD
Don’t tempt me. 
VELMA
Why ever not? Isn’t that how they 
got started?
LEONARD
Who?
VELMA
Adam and Eve. 
LEONARD
Oh them. 
VELMA
And that turned out ok.
LEONARD
You think so? I thought it was 
supposed to be the beginning of all 
human misery. 
VELMA
It’s never made me miserable. 
LEONARD
What?
VELMA
Temptation. 
LEONARD
Is that so? 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

VELMA
Uh-huh.
LEONARD
How do you manage?
VELMA
I struggle hard. Very hard. And 
then -
LEONARD
And then?
VELMA
I give in to it. 
Pull back from the screen to reveal --
CUT TO:
INT. MYCROFT’S HOUSE. PRIVATE CINEMA - NIGHT.

-- the film is showing on an old projector in a private 
cinema.
There’s only one, plush red velvet seat.
MYCROFT sits in it, as relaxed as we’ve ever seen him. Jacket 
off. Cup of tea. The film washes over his face. 
He’s enjoying himself.
On-screen: 
VELMA 
Now what was that about arresting 
me?
LEONARD 
Well, maybe not arresting you...
VELMA
No?
LEONARD
I could just keep you under close 
watch. 
Suddenly, the film flickers and, just for an instant, there’s 
a colour frame in it. 
Mycroft frowns. 
VELMA
Very close? 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

LEONARD
Uh-huh -
Another flicker. 
This time there are several colour frames. 
Home movie footage. 
A beach. 
Sunshine. 
A curly-haired little boy running across the sand. 
Next to him, a sullen older boy.  Mycroft stares at 
the screen. 
The Noir film reappears.
VELMA
Shame. I was looking forward to 
putting myself into the hands of 
the authorities. 
LEONARD
You were?
VELMA
Fingerprinting. Being searched. 
Thoroughly...
Then the colour film reappears again. 
The older boy glares at the camera. 
Then the film blurs and cuts to -
A glamorous couple, smiling in the sunshine. 
A very familiar couple.
Mr and Mrs Holmes, in their younger days...
Mycroft just stares - can’t keep his eyes off the screen. 
Suddenly the film starts to burn up. 
Mycroft gets to his feet and stops the film. 
A beam of dusty white light spears the darkness.
And on the screen, in blood red letters is written -
I’M BACK
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

Mycroft swallows.
He goes to the light switch. 
Click. 
The lights come on. 
Mycroft goes to the door. 
It won’t open. 
He rattles the door knob.
The lights go out. 
Now there’s only the dusty beam of the film projector to 
assuage the total darkness. 
Mycroft turns, breathing a little harder. 
Then, from out of the darkness, a chilling sound. 
A little girl...laughing. 
Mycroft freezes. 
The laugh comes again, a teasing, childish giggle. 
Then, running footsteps. As though a child were scampering 
across the floor. 
Mycroft peers into the darkness. 
No-one there. 
Then, a soft, sibilant, teasing baby-ish girl’s voice ...
GIRL’S VOICE
Mycroft...
Mycroft takes out his phone.
Dials a three digit number. 
GIRL’S VOICE (CONT’D)
Mycroft...
The phone rings. Then is answered.
MYCROFT
(into phone)
Protocol 784. Persephone.
This is clearly a pre-established MI6 distress call. But 
there is no reply. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

MYCROFT (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Persephone is go!
No reply. 
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Are you there?
And then, from the phone...
GIRL’S VOICE
(on phone)
Mycroft...
Mycroft lowers the phone. Calmly puts it back into his 
trouser pocket. 
Suddenly, the locked door creeeeeeks open. 
Beat. 
Mycroft looks out in the corridor beyond. 
It’s totally dark. 
Then, at the end of the corridor, a small, soft light springs 
into life.
Mycroft considers.
Then he glances over to where his jacket is on a coat-hanger. 
Hooked over this: his umbrella. 
He grabs the umbrella by the handle.
Twists it. 
Pulls off the furled section revealing it to be -
- a sword!
Armed with his bamboo-handled sword stick, Mycroft advances 
out into --
CUT TO:
INT. MYCROFT’S HOUSE. CORRIDOR - NIGHT.

- the corridor.
The soft glowing light at the end, suddenly dims as a small 
figure steps in front of it. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
7.


MYCROFT
Really, is there to be a parade of 
all the cliches? I don’t have time 
for this. 
GIRL’S VOICE
We have time, brother dear. All the 
time in the world... 
This impacts on Mycroft.
MYCROFT
Why don’t you just show yourself 
and get it over with?
The little girl’s giggle sounds again. 
Mycroft takes out his phone, activates the torch app.
In the glaring white light, dark ancestral portraits loom 
down from the walls. 
He advances slowly towards the figure at the end of the 
corridor, sword in hand. 
The figure is a little girl in pig-tails and a blue dress. We 
can’t yet make out her face. 
Mycroft moves closer.
Closer...
Closer...
He brings the phone torch to bear on the girl’s face but -
- she has no face!!
It’s a life-like mannequin.
The sound of scampering feet -
- Mycroft whirls round. A tiny figure dashes off round the 
corner. 
GIRL’S VOICE
Mycroft...
Mycroft pursues...
CUT TO:
INT. MYCROFT’S HOUSE. SECOND CORRIDOR - NIGHT.

MYCROFT passes a suit of armour on the corner. 
The girl giggles again. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
8.


MYCROFT
Who are you? 
GIRL’S VOICE
You know who...
MYCROFT
Impossible. 
GIRL’S VOICE
Nothing’s impossible. You of all 
people know that...
Something makes Mycroft turn towards the portraits on the 
wall. 
Georgians, Tudors. Perhaps they are ancient Holmes.
Suddenly, the pictures begin to weep blood. 
It trickles from their painted eyes and mouths, pooling on 
the panelled woodwork.
GIRL’S VOICE (CONT’D)
There’s an East wind coming, 
Mycroft. Coming to get you! 
A sound behind Mycroft. The suit of armour?
No. 
From behind the armour has stepped - a CLOWN!
A horrible, grinning freakish clown in candy stripe costume. 
It grabs the sword from the suit of armour and raises it!  
MYCROFT
You can’t have got out. You can’t. 
Mycroft raises his umbrella sword -
- then, unexpectedly, he whips out his handkerchief, wraps it 
round his hand and grabs the blade of his sword. It folds 
neatly back on itself producing -
- a gun barrel! 
Another twist of the handle, and a trigger appears.
Mycroft calmly aims the weapon and fires.
Bang! 
Bang! 
Bang! 
The Clown stops in its tracks. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
9.


Then there’s a clatter from close by. 
Mycroft looks down. 
Half a dozen bullets spill from the darkness across the 
floor. 
GIRL’S VOICE
No use, Mycroft. There’s no 
defence. And nowhere to hide...
The Clown starts to move again!
Mycroft swings up his umbrella gun - but the clown smashes it 
away with its sword. 
Mycroft flees down the darkened corridor, turning a corner 
into:

INT. MYCROFT’S HOUSE. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT
7

A sweeping staircase, a mighty front door. Moonlight streams 
through the grand window on the stairs, projecting a huge 
oblong of segmented moonlight over the entire hallway (as 
noir and surreal as we dare.)
Mycroft scrabbling, at the door, unable to open it for a 
moment -
- then a shadow is moving through the projected moonlight.
Mycroft looks up at staircase window, gapes.
Pulling back to an iconic shot - Mycroft cowering in the 
shadow now spread across the floor and wall: the most famous 
profile in the world, Sherlock Holmes in his deerstalker.
Holding on this for a moment. Then the shadow moves, as 
Sherlock opens the window and steps through.
MYCROFT
... Sherlock?
On Sherlock: just an eerie silhouette against the moonlight.
SHERLOCK
Brother mine.
MYCROFT
... help me..
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
11.


A beat -
- then Sherlock puts his fingers to his mouth and blows the 
most almighty whistle
The lights come up.
Stepping from the shadows, the various players in the drama. 
The clown. The little girl, pulling off her mask to reveal a 
dwarf.
All suddenly very ordinary, and very real.
SHERLOCK
Experiment complete. Conclusion: I 
have a sister.
MYCROFT
... this was you? All of this, you?
SHERLOCK
Conclusion two: my sister - Eurus, 
apparently - has been incarcerated 
from an early age in a secure 
institution under my brother’s 
control. Hey bro!
MYCROFT
Why would you do this? This 
pantomime, why?
SHERLOCK
Conclusion three: you are terrified 
of her.
MYCROFT
You have no idea what you’re 
dealing with. None at all.
A voice from behind Mycroft.
JOHN
New information.
Mycroft whirls. The front door is open now, John is leaning 
in the doorway.
JOHN (CONT’D)
She’s out.
MYCROFT
... that’s not possible.
SHERLOCK
(Coming down the stairs)
It’s more than possible, she was 
John’s therapist.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
12.


JOHN
Shot me in the face during a 
session.
SHERLOCK
Only with a tranquiliser.
JOHN
Yeah, and I still had ten minutes 
to go.
SHERLOCK
(to the players)
Right, you lot, Wiggins is at the 
gate, he’s got your money. Don’t 
spend it all in one crack den.
(To Mycroft)
We’ll show ourselves out. I hope we 
didn’t spoil your enjoyment of the 
movie.
He starts to head out.
MYCROFT
You’re just leaving!
SHERLOCK
Well we’re not staying here, Euros 
is coming - and someone’s disabled 
all your security. Sleep well!
He sweeps out. Now just John and a severely shaken Mycroft.
MYCROFT
Dr. Watson, why did he do that to 
me. That was insane.
JOHN
Yeah, well someone convinced him 
you’d never tell the truth unless 
you were actually wetting yourself.
MYCROFT
Someone?
JOHN
Probably me.
John turns to the door.
MYCROFT
That’s it, you’re just going to go?
JOHN
Oh, don’t worry. There’s a place 
for people like you - the 
desperate, the terrified, the ones 
with nowhere else to run ...
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
13.


MYCROFT
What place?
JOHN
221B Baker Street. See you in the 
morning. If there’s a queue, wait 
in it. 
Goes to the door -
MYCROFT
For God’s sake, this is not one of 
your idiot cases. 
JOHN
Oh, and you might want to close 
that window. There’s an East Wind 
coming.
Slams out.
Mycroft looks up towards the grand window - the curtains stir 
in the breeze.
Mycroft’s face: real fear.
CUT TO:
INT. 221 BAKER STREET - DAY.

Sherlock, in his chair, fingers steepled, eyes closed, 
waiting.
John, waiting in his chair, notebook at the ready. Fingers 
drumming, waiting.
The client chair, empty. Mycroft, stands a few feet behind. 
Out of place, unsure, indignant.
Mrs Hudson, standing in the doorway, arms folded, thoroughly 
enjoying his discomfiture.
MRS HUDSON
You have to sit in the chair. They 
won’t talk to you unless you sit in 
the chair, it’s the rules.
MYCROFT
For God’s sake! I’m not a client!
John and Sherlock glance at each other.
SHERLOCK
Then get out.
A moment. A capitulation. Like very movement is a personal 
affront, Mycroft seats himself in the client chair.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
14.


MYCROFT
She’s not going to stay there, is 
she?
Sherlock dismisses her with a nod of his head.
MRS HUDSON
(As she goes - to Mycroft)
Do you want a cup of tea?
MYCROFT
Thankyou.
MRS HUDSON
Kettle’s over there.
She goes. A pained silence.
MYCROFT
What happens now? Are you going to 
make deductions?
SHERLOCK
I just want the truth, Mycroft. 
Pure and simple.
MYCROFT
Who was it said “The truth is 
rarely pure and never simple”?
SHERLOCK
I don’t know. I don’t care. 
(Fixes Mycroft with a 
laser  glare)
There were three of us. I know that 
now. You, me and ... Eurus.
Mycroft looks at his brother then at John. A big moment. 
He nods.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
The sister I can’t remember.
Mycroft: nods again. Like he doesn’t want to say these words 
out loud.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Interesting name. Greek, isn’t it? 
JOHN
(Looking at a note he’s 
made)
Literally, the God of the East 
Wind. 
MYCROFT
Yes.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
15.


SHERLOCK
The East Wind.
MYCROFT
Yes.
SHERLOCK
“The East Wind is coming, 
Sherlock!” You used that to scare 
me. 
MYCROFT
No.
SHERLOCK
You turned my sister into a ghost 
story to bully me.
MYCROFT
Of course I didn’t. I monitored 
you.
JOHN
You what?
MYCROFT
Memories can resurface. Wounds can 
reopen. The roads we walk have 
demons beneath - and yours have 
been waiting for a very long time. 
I never bullied you. I used, at 
discreet intervals, potential 
trigger words, to update myself on 
your mental condition. I was 
looking after you.
SHERLOCK
Why don’t I remember her?
He glances at John.
MYCROFT
This is a private matter...
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
16.


SHERLOCK
John stays. 
MYCROFT
This is family.
SHERLOCK
That’s why he’s staying. 
Beat. Mycroft simmers but accepts.
JOHN
So. There were three Holmes kids. 
What was the age gap?
MYCROFT
Seven years between myself and 
Sherlock, one year between Sherlock 
and Eurus.
JOHN
Middle child - explains a lot. And 
did she have it too? 
MYCROFT
Have what?
JOHN
The deduction thing. 
MYCROFT
(disdainful)
The deduction thing? 
JOHN
Yes.
MYCROFT
More than you can know. 
JOHN
Enlighten me. 
MYCROFT
You realise I’m the smart one - 
SHERLOCK
As you never cease to announce.
MYCROFT
- but Eurus ... she was ...
incandescent. Even then. Our
abilities were professionally
assessed, more than once. I was
described as an era-defining
genius. Eurus was described as
beyond Newton.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
17-18.


SHERLOCK
So. Why don’t I remember her?
MYCROFT
You do remember her. In a way. 
Every choice you have ever made, 
every path you have taken - the man 
you are today is your memory of 
Eurus.
On Mycroft’s face - sunlight dapples across it, like he’s now 
seeing into the past ...
CUT TO:
EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY.

Mycroft’s POV - a flashback.
He is observing three children playing by a river.
They are a boy of thirteen (Mycroft), a curly haired boy of 
six in a skull and crossbones hat (Sherlock), and a girl, of 
five, in a blue dress and pigtails. The girl in the pigtails 
keeps her back to us. (She has a little toy in her hand, 
which we don’t focus, but she keeps throughout.)
With them is a bouncy red setter - REDBEARD.
The sun dazzles on the water.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
19.


MYCROFT
(V.O.)
She was different from the 
beginning. She knew things she 
should never have known. As if she 
was somehow aware of truths beyond 
the normal scope -
The little girl (Eurus) snaps her head round to look straight 
at the camera!
LITTLE EURUS
You look funny grown up.
CUT TO:
INT. 221 BAKER STREET - DAY
10
10
Mycroft still in his chair in Baker Street, startling out of 
his reverie.
JOHN
What’s wrong?
MYCROFT
Sorry. The memories are ... 
disturbing.
SHERLOCK
In what way? Examples! Illustrate!
MYCROFT
They found her with a knife once. 
She seemed to be cutting herself. 
Mother and father were terrified, 
they thought it was a suicide 
attempt - but when I asked Eurus 
what she was doing, she said:
And suddenly, Little Eurus is there, standing in front of the 
fireplace, looking icily at Mycroft.
LITTLE EURUS
I wanted to see how my muscles 
worked.
JOHN
... jesus.
MYCROFT
I asked her if it hurt. She didn’t 
understand the question. So I asked 
her if she could feel pain. She 
said:
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
20.


She’s back in front of Mycroft, cocking her head, 
quizzically.
LITTLE EURUS
Which one’s pain?
Sherlock and John, exchanging a glance. Wow!
SHERLOCK
So what happened?
Abruptly Mycroft gets so this feet, takes a couple of strides 
-
- on his feet as the carpet gives way to crunching gravel.
CUT TO:
EXT. MUSGRAVE HALL - DAY
11
11
Wider: Mycroft, Sherlock and John are in the grounds of a 
large, rambling gothic house.
MYCROFT
Musgrave...
SHERLOCK
Where we were brought up. The 
ancestral home.
He gestures to:
Close by - an overgrown family burial plot. Gravestones 
weathered by time, the names mostly unreadable. Just dates 
visible. 
One reads 134?-1719
Another 28.9.1520
Another 1818 (aged 24 and 26)
And one visible name:
NEMO HOLMES 1617- 1822 (aged 32)
MYCROFT
This is where we played pirates. 
And there was always honey for 
tea...
He’s now gesturing to the overgrown pirate ship climbing 
frame in the grounds, where the children are playing. Little 
Sherlock is dressed as a pirate.
A voice from inside: Mrs Holmes.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

MRS HOLMES (V.O.)
Come on, you lot! 
CUT TO:

21A.


INT. MUSGRAVE HALL. KITCHEN - DAY.
12
12
The three children are grouped around a large kitchen table. 
The back door is open, letting summer sunshine flood inside. 
Young MYCROFT is eating - a lot. 
Young SHERLOCK - still dressed as a pirate - is picking at 
his food, aware that EURUS, sitting across the way is staring 
at him. (No emphasis on this, but there is fourth plate set 
at the children’s table)
Eurus sings a lilting song, just under her breath. 
EURUS
“I that am lost, oh who will find 
me? Deep down below the old beech 
tree.”
Eurus is looking directly at Sherlock. Something wicked in 
her eye. Something horrible in her smile. Mrs Holmes - the 
younger version - comes bustling in, ruffles Sherlock’s hair.
YOUNG MRS HOLMES
Oh dear! Where’s Red Beard got to 
then?
She bustles on, not seeing little Sherlock’s frown, as his 
gaze is caught, in his sister’s increasingly sinister smile.
EURUS
“Help succour me now the east winds 
blow. Sixteen by six, brother, and 
under we go!”
Young Sherlock staring at her - something is wrong. He then 
slides back his chair and races outside. 
CUT TO:
EXT. MUSGRAVE HALL. GROUNDS - DAY. 
13
13
Young SHERLOCK races through the dense, wooded grounds of the 
estate, passing the gravestones again.
We pull back to reveal the older SHERLOCK, MYCROFT and JOHN 
looking on. 
JOHN
Redbeard?
SHERLOCK
My dog.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
22.


MYCROFT
She took Redbeard and locked him 
up. Somewhere no-one could find 
him. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

(MORE)


And she refused to say where he 
was. 
CUT TO:
INT. 221 BAKER STREET - DAY.

MYCROFT
She’d only repeat that song. Her 
little ... ritual.  
SHERLOCK
(to himself)
“I that am lost, oh who will find 
me? Deep down below the old beech 
tree. Help succour me now the east 
winds blow ...
MYCROFT
Sixteen by six, brother, and under 
we go! You’re starting to remember. 
SHERLOCK
Fragments. What happened to 
Redbeard?
MYCROFT
Exactly what do you remember of 
him?
SHERLOCK
He was my dog, he died. Just tell 
me.
MYCROFT
(A beat - a decision)
We never found him. But she started 
calling him drowned redbeard, so we 
made our assumptions.
Beat.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Sherlock was traumatised. Natural, 
I suppose - he was, in the early 
days, an emotional child. But after 
that he was different. So changed. 
Never spoke about it again. In 
time, he seemed to forget that 
Eurus had ever even existed -
JOHN
How could he forget, she was living 
in the same house!
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

MYCROFT (CONT'D)


MYCROFT
No. They took her away.
CUT TO:

EURUS sits on a chair, a big smile on her face. Behind her, 
there is a policeman, taking notes.
JOHN (V.O.)
Why?
CUT TO:
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY
16

JOHN
You don’t lock a kid up because a 
dog goes missing.
MYCROFT
Quite so. It was what happened 
immediately afterwards...
CUT TO:
INT. MUSGRAVE HALL. EURUS’ ROOM - NIGHT. 
17
17
EURUS sits alone on her bed, still smiling her unnerving, 
beatific smile. 
She gets down onto the floor and starts leafing through a 
pile of papers.
They’re all children’s paintings.
Stick figure versions of the Holmes family and the looming 
Musgrave Hall. 
Each figure has a name next to it. 
‘Mummy’. ‘Daddy’. ‘Mycroft’. ‘Eurus’. 
Then ‘Sherlock’. 
But the Sherlock figure has been viciously crossed out. 
As Eurus sorts through the paintings, we see that in each 
one, Sherlock’s image has been erased or stabbed at or 
scrawled through. 
Arguing voices from below. Mummy and Daddy. What are they 
saying?

MR HOLMES
(From off)
But she knows where he is!
MRS HOLMES
(From off)
We can’t make her tell us. We can’t 
make her do anything!
Eurus is pulling something from her dress.
A box of matches. 
She shakes the box then takes out a single match and strikes 
it. Then she sets light to the pictures.
She steps back and surveys her work as the fire takes hold. 
The flames dance in her eyes.

MYCROFT
After that, our sister had to be 
taken away.
SHERLOCK
Where?
MYCROFT
Oh, some suitable place, or so 
everyone thought. Not suitable, 
enough, however - she died there.
JOHN
How?
MYCROFT
She started another fire. One which 
she did not survive.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
25.


SHERLOCK
This is a lie.
MYCROFT
Yes. It is also a kindness. This is 
the story I told our parents - to 
spare them further pain and to 
account for the absence of an 
identifiable body.
SHERLOCK
And also to prevent their further 
interference -
MYCROFT
That too, of course. The depth of 
Eurus’s psychosis, and the extent 
of her abilities, could not hope to 
be contained in any ordinary 
institution. Uncle Rudi took care 
of things.
SHERLOCK
Where is she? Where’s our sister?
MYCROFT
... there is a place. Called 
Sherrinford. An island ... 
The wall behind Mycroft falls to darkness -
- then fades up as an image of castle-like structure on an 
island, as if he were sitting on beach.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
It’s a secure and very secret 
installation whose sole purpose is 
to contain what we call the 
uncontainables. The demons beneath 
the road - this is where we trap 
them.
Another angle on Mycroft, and we lose the image of the island 
fortress.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Sherrinford is more than a prison 
or an asylum - it is a fortress 
built to keep the rest of the world 
safe from what’s inside it. Heaven 
may be a fantasy for the credulous 
and the afraid - but I can give you 
a map reference for hell. That is 
where our sister has been since 
early childhood. She has not left, 
not for a single day. Whoever you 
both met, it can’t have been her.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

And on that word “her” the breaking of a window. All the 
three men startle out of their chairs, looking towards the 
back of the flat -
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
26A.


A rising whine of machinery. Something is back there in the 
flat.
- and now coming from Sherlock’s bedroom, is a sing-song
voice, that could almost be a child.
EURUS
(V.O.)
Be not afraid to walk in the shade
Save one, save all, come try!
My steps - five by seven
Life is closer to Heaven
Look down, with dark gaze, from on 
high.
MYCROFT
Eurus! Oh dear God, Eurus!
And now the whine of machinery gets a little louder, and 
floating through the door of Sherlock’s bedroom ...
... an eerily hovering drone. On top, some machinery is 
mounted, including a little speaker, from which the voice 
comes.
EURUS
(V.O.)
Before he was gone - right back 
over my hill. Who now will find 
him? Why, nobody will.
Doom shall I bring to him, I that 
am queen. Lost forever, nine by 
nineteen.
JOHN
What is it?
SHERLOCK
A drone.
The drone, now passing right in front of John’s face, 
terrifying close.
JOHN
I can see that, what’s it carrying?
EURUS
(V.O.)
Without your love, he'll be gone 
before. Save pity for strangers, 
show love the door.
My soul seek the shade of my 
willow's bloom. Inside, brother 
mine - Let Death make a room.
On top of the drone, beside the little speaker, is what looks 
like a silver egg, about the size of a grenade.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

MYCROFT
Both of you stay back, stay as 
still as possible.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
27A.


The drone is slowly descending to the floor. It now sits 
there. (The three men - having moved around as the drone 
entered - now stand so that Sherlock and John are by the 
windows, and Mycroft by the open door to the stairs.)
SHERLOCK
The silver thing on top. What is 
it? 
MYCROFT
A DX-707. I’ve authorised the 
purchase of quite a number of 
these. Colloquially, it is known as 
the patience grenade.
JOHN
Patience?
A light has flicked on on the silver egg.
MYCROFT
The motion sensor has activated. If 
any of us move, the grenade will 
detonate.
SHERLOCK
How powerful?
MYCROFT
It will certainly destroy this 
flat, and kill anyone in it. 
Assuming walls of reasonable 
strength, your neighbours should be 
safe, but as it’s resting on the 
floor, I am moved to wonder if the 
cafe below is open.
SHERLOCK
(Shake of head)

The three men, listening.
MYCROFT
... how long has she been 
vacuuming?
SHERLOCK
Going by her usual pattern, she has 
about two minutes left.
JOHN
She keeps the vacuum cleaner at the 
back of her flat.
MYCROFT
So?
JOHN
Safer there? When she’s putting it 
away? 
They look at him.
JOHN (CONT’D)
We have to move eventually, we 
should choose when she’s safest, 
yeah?
SHERLOCK
Okay. Once the vacuum cleaner stops 
we give her eight seconds to get to 
the back of her flat - she’s fast 
when she’s cleaning - then we move. 
(To Mycroft)
What’s the trigger response time - 
once we’re mobile how long before 
detonation.
MYCROFT
We have a maximum of three seconds 
to vacate the blast radius.
SHERLOCK
John and I will take the window. 
You take the stairs. Help Mrs 
Hudson get out too.
MYCROFT
Me?? 
SHERLOCK
You’re the closest to the stairs.
MYCROFT
You’re faster.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

SHERLOCK
The speed differential will be less 
critical than the distance. 
MYCROFT
(Oh shit)
Yes, agreed.
JOHN
(Listening)
She’s further away now - moving to 
the back.
SHERLOCK
We have approximately one minute 
then. Is a phone call possible?
MYCROFT
A phone call?
SHERLOCK
John has a daughter. He may wish 
say goodbye.
MYCROFT
I’m sorry, Dr. Watson. Any movement 
will set the grenade off. I hope 
you understand.
John: says nothing for a moment. Finally:
JOHN
Oscar Wilde. 
MYCROFT
I’m sorry?
JOHN
He said “The truth is rarely pure 
and never simple” It was in “The 
Importance Of Being Earnest”, we 
did it at school.
MYCROFT
So did we, now that I recall.
(Sad smile, so long ago)
I was Lady Bracknell.
SHERLOCK
Yeah. You were great actually.
MYCROFT
Did you really think so?
SHERLOCK
Yes, I really did.

Well that’s good to know. I always 
wondered.
Below, the vacuum cleaner stops.
They look at each other. 
SHERLOCK
Good luck, boys! ..... 3 ... 2 ...

Hyper slow motion.
- Mycroft starts to spin towards the stairs -

The ship’s radio is on. The shipping forecast. 
An older crewman, VINCE, staggers into the cabin. He laughs 
as he sees Ben’s face. 
VINCE
Go on, son. Get it out. Better out

BEN
Is it always like this?
VINCE
No.

On an upper gallery there’s a control room, monitoring the 
whole place.

screen in front of him.
TECHNICIAN

Missing.

No, he’s not. He’s here.

TECHNICIAN
Sir?
The Governor looks round. The technician is pointing to one 
of the screen.
TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
Found two more from the boat.
On the screen - footage as from a phone.
Two men - one of them is clearly John Watson. The other looks 
like a boatman, thick set, bearded. They both have their 
hands up, as if being held at gun point by the holder of the 
phone. The Boatman is protesting in thick Cornish accent (we 
should barely hear this.)
BOATMAN
He stole our boat. Him and the 
other fella - with guns.

Immediately, the Boatman is on his feet.
BOATMAN
This is a mistake, I’m the victim 
here. This man stole my boat, he’s 
a pirate.

I am, technically, a pirate.

Please sit down.
BOATMAN
I don’t even know who he is!

He’s passes a little credit-card sized pass to Landers.
LANDERS
Sir, I can’t leave you alone with 
the prisoners -
But the Governor is already opening the door for him, 
practically bundling him out.

If there’s any change in her 
condition, report to me in person,

Closes the door on him.
He turns to the two men.

I’m sparing your blushes because 
we’re supposed to be on the same

JOHN
Is it going to be a cavity search?

The true art of disguise - 
according to your famous friend - 
is not being looked at.

But I’m looking at you - aren’t I, 
Mr. Holmes?
A silence. The Boatman relaxes.
BOATMAN
(Still Cornish)
Yes, you are.
JOHN
But that’s the point, I’m afraid.

As he gets into the lift, he turns to face us -

Holmes.
He touches the card to the lift console, the doors slide 
shut.
(NB - Sherlock’s disguise should be tiny. Maybe a moustache, 
or dark glasses. Daringly minimalist. We pull this off by 
never focussing on him, keeping him at the back of shot, 
emphasising the more “operatic” performance from Mycroft. 
Ideally, when you rewind, you should be astonished that you

clown outfits - at least they’d be 
satirically relevant.
JOHN
You’ll find the real Landers on the 
North shore. Tied up with two 
others.
THE GOVERNOR
Two others?
JOHN
Trial and error. We had trouble 
finding the right waistband.
THE GOVERNOR
This is insane. This is 
unnecessary.
JOHN
Your security is compromised. We 
don’t know who we can trust.
THE GOVERNOR
And that justifies dressing up??
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

Mycroft turns from the mirror - and he is thunderous.
MYCROFT
Yes! It! Does! It justifies any 
dressing up or any damn thing I say 
it does. Now listen! For your 
physical safety, do not speak. Do 
not indulge in any non-verbal 
signals suggestive of internal 
thought. If the safety of my sister 
is compromised, if the security of 
my sister is compromised, if the 
incarceration of my sister is 
compromised - in short, if I find 
any indication that my sister may 
have left this island at any time, 
then I swear to you ... you will 
not.

Say thankyou to Dr. Watson.

At one side there is a drawer, for objects to be passed from

As Sherlock slowly enters, he sees his sister, her back to 
him, playing the violin. (The violin still sounds a little 
tinny and compressed, as being heard through a speaker.)
He closes the door behind him - the music suddenly snaps to 
silence.
Eurus has frozen, eerily still - a slight figure in her 
smock, bowed over the violin.
Sherlock freezes too. Unnerved, in spite of himself.

EURUS
My special hairband. 
SHERLOCK
I’m not one of your doctors.
EURUS
The one I made you steal from 
Mummy.
On Sherlock. Freezing. Realising she is talking to him. She 
doesn’t think he’s a doctor, she knows exactly who he is.
Now, she turns. Sherlock and his sister, face to face, 
through the glass.
Finally:
EURUS (CONT’D)
It was the last thing I said to 
you. The day they took me away.
SHERLOCK
No.
EURUS
No?
SHERLOCK
We’ve spoken since then. You came 
to my flat. A few weeks ago. You 
pretended to be a woman called 
Faith Smith - we had chips.
EURUS
Does this mean you didn’t bring my 
hairband?
SHERLOCK
How did you get out of this place? 
How did you do that?
EURUS
Easy. Look at me.
SHERLOCK
I am looking at you.
FAITH
You can’t see it, can you. You try 
and try, but you just can’t see. 
You can’t look.

SHERLOCK
See what?
She holds up her violin.
EURUS
What do you think?
SHERLOCK
Beautiful. 
EURUS
You’re not looking at it.
SHERLOCK
I meant your playing.
EURUS
Oh, the music. I never know if it’s 
beautiful or not. Only if it’s 
right.
SHERLOCK
Often they’re the same thing.
EURUS
If they’re not always the same 
thing, what’s the point in beauty? 
Look at the violin.
SHERLOCK
I need to know how you escaped.
EURUS
Look at the violin.
Finally, he glances down at the violin in her hands. 
Realises.
SHERLOCK
... it’s a Stradivarius.
EURUS
It’s a gift.
SHERLOCK
Who from?
EURUS
Me.
She moves to the drawer at the side of the glass wall, places 
the violin and bow inside, slides it through to Sherlock’s 
side.
Sherlock extracts the violin, examines it, impressed.

EURUS

SHERLOCK
How did you know?

How did I know??
Sherlock, looking at her bemused. She’s almost looking hurt 
now. Genuinely upset.
EURUS (CONT’D)
I taught you. Don’t you remember? 
How can you not remember that?
SHERLOCK
Eurus ... I don’t remember you at 
all.
She stares at him. For the first time, surprised. 
EURUS
Oh, interesting. Mycroft told me 
you’re rewritten your memories. He 
didn’t tell me you’d written me out 
completely.
SHERLOCK
What do you mean, rewritten?

You still don’t know about

Enslaved them.
MYCROFT
She was capable of that at seven. 
She’s an adult now. I warned you. I 
ordered you.
THE GOVERNOR
She is clinically unique. We had to 
try. 
MYCROFT
At what cost? 
The Governor: silent.
For a moment, we hear Eurus on the tape, isolated.
EURUS ON TAPE
Happiness is a pop song.
MYCROFT
At what cost. Tell me the worst 
thing that has happened. 
EURUS ON TAPE
Sadness is a poem.
THE GOVERNOR
... She kept suggesting to Dr. 
Taylor that he should kill his 
family.
MYCROFT
And?
THE GOVERNOR
He said she was like an earworm, he 
couldn’t get her out of his head.
MYCROFT
And?

He left.

Oh! Have you had sex?
With effort, Sherlock doesn’t miss a beat.
SHERLOCK
Why do you ask?
EURUS
The music. I’ve had sex.
SHERLOCK

EURUS
One of the nurses got careless. I 
liked it. Messy though. People are 
so breakable.
SHERLOCK
I take it he didn’t consent.
EURUS
He?
SHERLOCK
She?
EURUS
I’m afraid I didn’t notice in the

You spoke to her.

You, me, and Mycroft. Mycroft was 
quite clever, in his little way. He

a bit slow. But you - you were my 
favourite.
He takes a step forward.
SHERLOCK
Why was I your favourite?
Eurus considers. Smiles. She too takes a step forward to the 
glass.
EURUS
Because I could make you laugh. I 
loved it when you laughed. Once I 
made you laugh all night, I thought 
you were going to burst - I was so 
happy. Then Mummy and Daddy had to 
stop me, of course.
SHERLOCK
Why?

Well, turns out I’d got it wrong. 
Apparently you were screaming.

Why was I screaming?

Cut wider: there’s no crowd at all. Just the Governor and two 
orderlies waiting at the perimeter of the helipad.
Back on Moriarty. He gives “oh you guys!” wave at his 
imaginary crowd, and pops the earbuds of his ears.

Two Spooks in black suits have climbed out of the helicopter.

The Girl as we last saw her, staring out of the plane window. 
The plane rocks and bucks. (Intercut with cell as required.)
THE GIRL
Hello, I can hear you talking, 
please help me.
SHERLOCK
Hello. Try to be calm. What’s your 
name?
Silence: the girl doesn’t want to say.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Hello? What’s your name.
THE GIRL
I’m not supposed to tell my name to 
strangers.
SHERLOCK
Okay, that’s fine. But my name is 
Sherl - ...
And Sherlock’s voice cuts off, replaced by the dialling tone.
On the Girl’s face - such panic!!
GIRL
Hello? Please, hello?
CUT TO:
INT. EURUS’S CELL - NIGHT

The dialling also here. 
SHERLOCK
Hello?
EURUS
(On screen)
Oh dear. We seem to have lost the 
connection.
They all look to the television - the picture has come on and 
Eurus, in close up, is smiling at them.
MYCROFT
How have you done this? How is any 
of this possible?
EURUS ON SCREEN
You put me in here, Mycroft. You 
brought me my treats.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

On Sherlock, registering the word “treats”!
JOHN
Treats. What kind of treats?
SHERLOCK
You got it wrong, Mycroft. You 
thought she was a prisoner. But she 
was a queen bee. And cell by cell 
she has built her hive. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

Eurus, now seated in the control room of her cell. Relaxed, 
feet up on the console - the new queen. She is flanked by her 
orderlies. (We intercut with the cell as required.)
EURUS
(On screen)
Oh, the melodrama, it’s unbearable.  
This isn’t a hive, it’s an ant 
hill. And I’m setting fire to it.
JOHN
(On screen)
Why?
EURUS
I’m conducting an experiment. I 
want to understand ants.
She flicks a switch -
- and we hear Jim Moriarty’s voice on the tannoy.
MORIARTY ON TANNOY
Clever Eurus! You go girl!
JOHN
How can that be Moriarty?
EURUS
Oh he recorded loads of little 
messages for me, before he died, he 
loved it. Did you know his brother 
was a station master? I think he 
was always jealous.
SHERLOCK
The girl - where did she go? Can I 
talk to her again?
EURUS
Poor little thing. Alone in the sky 
on a great big plane, with nowhere 
to land. But where in the world is 
she? It’s a clever little puzzle. 
If you want to apply yourself to 
it, I can reconnect you. But first 
...
She clicks her fingers -
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
69.


- and a terrified woman is dragged into camera view, behind
her. She is blindfolded and gagged.
THE GOVERNOR
That’s my wife. Oh God, that’s my 
wife. 
EURUS
I’m going to shoot the Governor’s 
wife.
THE GOVERNOR
Please, no, please help her.
EURUS
In about a minute. Bang, brains.
SHERLOCK
Please don’t do that.
EURUS ON SCREEN
You can stop me.
SHERLOCK
How.
EURUS
There’s a gun on top of the 
television. Take it.
Sherlock steps to the television. Takes the gun.
EURUS (CONT’D)
If you want to save the governor’s 
wife, choose one of Dr. Watson or 
Mycroft, to kill the governor.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
69A.


THE GOVERNOR
Oh God. Oh dear God.
EURUS
You can’t do it, Sherlock. If you 
do it, it won’t count, I’ll kill 
her anyway. It has to be your 
brother or your friend.
A terrible silence
THE GOVERNOR
... please. You have to do this. 
She means it, she will kill her.
Sherlock slowly looks to Mycroft.
SHERLOCK
I don’t think we have a choice.
He holds the gun out to him.
EURUS
Right then! Countdown starting.
MYCROFT
... how long?
EURUS
The countdown is for me. 
Withholding the precise deadline 
will apply the emotional pressure 
more evenly. Where possible, please 
give me an explicit verbal 
indication of your anxiety levels, 
I can’t always read them from your 
behaviour.
MYCROFT
I can’t. I can’t do this. It’s 
murder.
THE GOVERNOR
It’s not murder, it’s saving my 
wife.
EUROS
I’m particularly focussed on 
internal conflicts, where 
strategising round a largely 
intuitive moral code appears to 
create a counter-intuitive result.
MYCROFT
I will not kill. I will not have 
blood on my hands.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
70.


EURUS
Yes, very good, thankyou.
THE GOVERNOR
Killing my wife is what you’re 
doing??
MYCROFT
No.
EURUS
You see?
Mycroft steps away. Beaten, frightened.
Sherlock turns his gaze on John - who can barely meet it.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
70A.


SHERLOCK
John?
John says nothing, doesn’t look at him.
THE GOVERNOR
Dr. Watson, are you married?
JOHN
I was.
THE GOVERNOR
What happened?
JOHN
She died?
THE GOVERNOR
What would you give to bring her 
back? If you could, if it was 
possible, what would you do to save 
her?
John’s eyes move reluctantly to the gun Sherlock is holding 
out.
THE GOVERNOR (CONT’D)
She’ll kill me anyway - save my 
wife.
Eurus clicks a switch. Jim Moriarty’s voice on the tannoy. 
TANNOY MORIARTY
Tick tock, tick tock.
His face also pops up on a screen. This now happens evert 
time he intervenes, so we have the option of cutting to him.
EURUS
There will, I’m afraid, be regular 
prompts to create an atmosphere of 
urgency.
TANNOY MORIARTY
Tick tock, goes the clock.
John takes the gun, moves to behind the Governor as he kneels 
on the floor.
JOHN
What’s your name?
THE GOVERNOR
David.
JOHN
Are you sure, David?
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
71.


THE GOVERNOR
Of course I’m bloody sure.
SHERLOCK
(Looking hard at John)
Are you?
John can barely look at him.
THE GOVERNOR
Please. Please.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
71A.


EURUS
Nearly there, nearly time.
JOHN
(Readying the gun)
Do you need to pray? Anything like 
that?
THE GOVERNOR
In a world with Eurus Holmes, there 
can be no one to pray to.
JOHN
You’re a good man, and you’re doing 
a good thing. 
THE GOVERNOR
So are you.
JOHN
I’m going to spend the rest of my 
life telling myself that.
John, moving behind the Governor.
THE GOVERNOR
Oh God. Oh God.
JOHN
You’re very scared but you should 
also be proud -
THE GOVERNOR
Please just do it, just be quick.
TANNOY MORIARTY
Tick tock tick tock, ticketty 
tocketty.
JOHN
Good-bye David.
The Governor closes his eyes ready.
John’s hand trembling on the gun.
TANNOY VOICE
Tick tock tick tock.
THE GOVERNOR
Please!
John a world of pain in his face. Grimacing, trying to will 
that trigger pulled.
The gun trembling.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
72.


EURUS
Any second now. This is very good, 
Dr. Watson. I should have fitted 
you with a cardiograph.
Then John: soft-spoken, but such pain.
JOHN
I can’t. I’m sorry, I can’t.
SHERLOCK
I know.
EURUS
It’s okay, don’t worry. It’s all 
useful data.
With an anguished scream, the Governor twists round, wrenches 
the gun from John -
JOHN
No, stop, no!
- and rams the gun under his own chin.
Now, on Sherlock, John and Mycroft, watching in horror.
THE GOVERNOR
I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Remember me!
The last word is cut off by BLAM! We stay on three men, 
appalled -
- as we hear the body fall like a sack of cement. (NB No 
blood, suicide off-screen.)
A throbbing silence.
Mycroft, now over at the wall, vomiting.
Sherlock looks coldly at him, then to his friend.
John, shaken to the core. He was weak, and knows it.
SHERLOCK
You okay?
John, still staring at the dead man. Gives a tiny shake of 
his head. He’s nowhere close to okay.
Sherlock turns to the television, and Eurus.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Right, there you go, got what you 
wanted. He’s dead.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
73.


EURUS
Dead or alive, he really wasn’t 
very interesting. But you three 
were wonderful, thankyou. You see 
what you did, Dr. Watson? 
Specifically because of your moral 
code - because you don’t want blood 
on your hands - two people are 
dead, instead of one.
JOHN
... two people?
EURUS
Yes, sorry, hang on. 
(She glances off)
Would you mind?
And blam! from the television.
Eurus reaches up and moves the camera so that we now have a 
view of the Governor’s wife hanging limp in her chair. (NB - 
again, we don’t see the shooting.)
EURUS (CONT’D)
What advantage did your moral code 
grant you? Is it not, in the end, 
selfish to keep one’s hands clean, 
at the expense of another’s life?
JOHN
You didn’t have to kill her.
EURUS
The condition of her survival was 
that you or Mycroft had to kill her  
husband. This an experiment, there 
will be rigour. 
John, just staring at her - no words.
EURUS (CONT’D)
Sherlock, pick up the gun. It’s 
your turn next. When I tell you to 
use it - and I will - remember what 
happened this time.
Sherlock eyes the gun on the floor - it’s partly blood 
spattered. He makes no move to pick it.
SHERLOCK
What if I don’t want a gun.
EURUS
The gun is intended as a mercy.
SHERLOCK
For who?
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
74.


EURUS
You. 
SHERLOCK
How so?
EURUS
If someone else had to die, would 
you really want to do it with your 
bare hands? It would waste valuable 
time.
A moment, as that moment lands, for the three of them. 
Mycroft, terrified. John, stoic. Sherlock, still unsure.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
74A.


JOHN
Probably just take it.
Sherlock, stiff little nod. Steps forward, picks up the gun.
SHERLOCK
There’s only one bullet left.
EURUS
You will only need one. But you 
will need it.
Sherlock looks to Mycroft, looks to John - no choice. He 
shoves the gun into his belt.
A door is sliding open at the back of cell.
EURUS (CONT’D)
Please go through. There’s a few 
tasks for you, and a girl on a 
plane who’s getting very, very 
scared.
John and Mycroft move towards it - but Sherlock hangs back a 
beat.
SHERLOCK
Treats?
MYCROFT
Just, you know ... a violin.
SHERLOCK
In exchange for?
MYCROFT
... she’s very clever.
Sherlock, looking so coldly at him.
SHERLOCK
I’m beginning to think you’re not.
Avoiding his brother’s gaze, Mycroft heads on. 
Sherlock, giving him the deadliest route, now following.
Sherlock, John and Mycroft, walking through to -

SHERLOCK
Someone’s been redecorating.
JOHN
Is that allowed? 
SHERLOCK
She’s literally taken over the 
asylum. We have more to worry about 
than the colour scheme.
Mycroft is touching the paintwork.
MYCROFT
Barely dry - recent.
SHERLOCK
For our benefit then.
There are three tall windows at the far end of the cell - the 
red velvet curtains hang down over them, blocking the 
daylight. They look around.
Eurus’s face appears on a screen.

SHERLOCK
Listen, everything’s going to be 
fine. But I need you to tell me 
where you are. Outside, is it day 
or night? 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

GIRL

MYCROFT
Well that certainly narrows it down

SHERLOCK
What kind of plane are you on?
GIRL
I don’t know.
JOHN
Is it big or small?
GIRL
Big?
JOHN
Lots of people on it?
GIRL
Lots and lots. But they’re all 
asleep, I can’t wake them up. 
SHERLOCK
Where did you take off from?
GIRL
The driver’s asleep.
SHERLOCK
I understand. Where do you come 
from, where did the plane take off?
GIRL
My Nan’s.

That’s enough for now. Time to play

front of you -
MYCROFT
Passenger jet, crew and passengers 
unconscious, except for that girl. 
It’s going to crash -
EURUS
(On screen)
Patience! If you want to speak to 
the girl again, look on the table. 
Earn yourself some phone time!
Before them, on the table are four photos. The first is a a 
sad-looking man with a target on his chest.

Garrideb, Alex Garrideb and Howard 
Garrideb. 
Close on the remaining three photos on the table.

NATHAN - 20s, skinny jeans and hoodie, glasses.
ALEX - 30s, round-faced, flash suit. 
HOWARD - 30s, scruffy.
EURUS (CONT’D)
All these pictures are up to date. 
But which one pulled the trigger, 
Sherlock? Which one?
JOHN
That’s it? We’re supposed to work 
it out based on - what? 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

Sherlock grabs the rifle.
SHERLOCK
This. This is all we have. 
EURUS
Please make use of your friends, 
Sherlock. I want to see you 
interact with people you’re close 
to. Also may have to choose which 
one to keep.
Sherlock ignores her, coldly examining the rifle.
SHERLOCK
(to Mycroft)
What do you make of it?
MYCROFT
Am I being asked to prove my 
usefulness?
SHERLOCK
Yes, I should think you are. 
MYCROFT
I will not be manipulated like this 
-
SHERLOCK
Fine.
(Turns to John)
John?
Sherlock just turns away from him, to John.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
John?
JOHN
Think I’ve seen of these. A Buffalo 
gun. Mid 1950s. Old-fashioned 
sight. No cross-hairs -
Sherlock stares at the photos on the table. 
SHERLOCK
Glasses. Nathan wears glasses.

hundred metres away. The kick back

Sherlock jabs at the photo.
SHERLOCK
No cuts. No scarring. Not Nathan, 
then. Who’s next?
MYCROFT
Oh, very good, Dr. Watson, how 
useful you are! Do you have 
suspicion that we are being made to 
compete?
JOHN
No. We’re not competing - there’s a 
plane in the sky and it’s going to 
crash and what we’re doing is 
trying to save a little girl. 
Today, we have to be soldiers - 
which means to hell with what 
happens to us!
On Mycroft, struck by that - fair point.
MYCROFT
... your priorities do you credit.
JOHN
I just got a woman killed - no they 
bloody don’t.
From the monitor. 
EURUS
Now as I understand it, Sherlock, 
you try to repress your emotions to 
refine your reasoning. I’d like to 
see how that works so if you don’t 
mind, I’m going to apply some 
context to your deductions. 
Suddenly, the red curtain on the window rise upwards, 
revealing the three named men. Each on is hanging from their 
wrists, just outside the window. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

Terrified, they sway in the wind. They look much as they 
looked in their photos. Nathan, Alex and Howard.
All three wear name badges.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
80A.


MYCROFT
Oh dear Lord.
EURUS
Two of the Garridebs work here as 
orderlies, so getting the third 
along wasn’t too difficult. Once 
you bring in your verdict, let me 
know and justice will be done.
SHERLOCK
Justice?
JOHN
What will you do to them?
EURUS
Early release.
Sherlock has gone to the window, looking down.
SHERLOCK
You’ll drop them into the sea.
EURUS
Sink or swim.
JOHN
They’re tied up.
MYCROFT
We’d be as good as killing them.
EURUS
Exactly. Now there is context. 
Please continue with your 
deductions. I’m now focussing on 
the difference to your mental 
capacity a specified consequence 
can make.
MYCROFT
Why should we bother? What if we 
are disinclined to play your games, 
little sister?

I have, if you remember, provided

Eurus disappears from the screen, the countdown clock returns

No way he could have taken that 
shot from three hundred metres 
away. Which leaves us with 
-- Alex. 
Alex, hanging at the window, looks utterly terrified, 
pleading silently.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(Peering close at his 
face)
Indentations on the temples suggest 
he habitually wears glasses, also 
the frown lines suggest a lifetime 
of peering -
MYCROFT
(rallying a little)
He’s short-sighted - or he was. His 
recent laser surgery has done the 
trick though. 
SHERLOCK
Laser surgery?
MYCROFT
Look at his clothes. He’s made an 
effort. 
JOHN
That’s good!
SHERLOCK
(nods)
Excellent! Suddenly sees himself in 
quite a different light now he’s 
dumped the specs. Attractive. 
Debonair. Even has a spray tan.
But he’s not used to a personal 
grooming ritual as is obvious from 
the state of his fingernails --
Sherlock vision: Alex’s long and dirty nails. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
-- and the hair growing in his 
ears. 
Sherlock vision: bristly hairs sprout from Alex’s ears. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
It’s a superficial job. But his 
eyesight was fixed, his hand was 
steady. He pulled the trigger. He 
killed Evans. 
EURUS
Are you ready to condemn the 
prisoner?
MYCROFT
Sherlock, we can’t do this! 
SHERLOCK
The plane, remember.
EURUS
Sherlock, are you ready?
Mycroft can’t bear this, looks away. Sherlock and John look 
at each other. No choice.
SHERLOCK
Alex.
EURUS
Say it. Condemn him. Condemn him in 
the knowledge of what will happen 
to the man you name.
SHERLOCK
I condemn Alex Garrideb.
At the console, Eurus calmly slams a lever.
- and the other two Garridebs plunge from sight!
TANNOY MORIARTY
Mind the gap.
Alex Garrideb, his terrified eyes darting. He’s alive, can’t 
believe it.
The door to the next room swishes open.  
Beyond - a black room. 
EURUS
Congratulations. You got the right 
one. Now go through the door.
JOHN
You dropped the other two? Why? 
EURUS
Interesting - 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

JOHN
(fury)
WHY?!
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
84A.


EURUS
- These arbitrary little
distinctions between right and
wrong. It’s no more than having a
favourite colour. Why choose? It’s
like smell. A human’s sense of
smell is limited - only registers
good and bad. Attractive or
repulsive. But a dog’s sense of
smell can read the whole world like
a book, and so doesn’t need the
crudity of value judgments. Good
and bad are simplifications for
smaller minds. I therefore struggle
with them.
JOHN
What’s wrong with you, for Christ’s 
sake?!
EURUS
Well, I’ve been here for thirty 
years, Dr. Watson and no one’s 
found anything at all. So the 
natural next step is for me to find 
out what’s wrong with everybody 
else. For instance, does it really 
make a difference, killing the 
innocent instead of the guilty?
JOHN
Yes!
EURUS
Okay, let’s see.
Another slam of lever, and the final Garrideb drops out of 
sight. 
TANNOY MORIARTY
The train has left the station.
EURUS
No, you see, that felt pretty much 
the same.
SHERLOCK
John, don’t let her distract you.

Are there ships on it?
THE GIRL
No ships. I can see lights in the 
distance.
SHERLOCK
Is it a city?
THE GIRL
I think so.
SHERLOCK looks at MYCROFT and JOHN. 
MYCROFT
(Lowers voice, so as not 
be heard by girl)
She’s about to fly over a city in a 
pilotless plane. We’ll have to talk 
her through it. 
JOHN
Through what?
GIRL
Hello, are you still there, hello?
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
86.


SHERLOCK
Still here, give us a moment.
MYCROFT
(Sotto)
Getting the plane away from that 
city, away from any mainland. It 
has to crash at sea.
GIRL
Please keep talking to me, I’m 
scared.
JOHN
(Sotto)
What about the girl?
MYCROFT
(Sotto)
Obviously, Dr. Watson, she’s the 
one who going to crash it.
JOHN
(Sotto)
We could help her land it?
MYCROFT
(Sotto)
And if we fail, and she crashes 
into a city, how many will die 
then?
GIRL
Hello?
JOHN
(Sotto)
And how do we get her to do that?
GIRL
I’m scared, don’t leave me alone.
MYCROFT
(Sotto)
... I’m afraid we will have to give 
her hope.
On Sherlock - even for him, this is unbearable.
SHERLOCK
(To the Girl)
Is there really no one there who 
can help you, have you really 
checked.
GIRL
Everyone’s asleep. Will you help 
me? 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
87.


Sherlock looks to Mycroft - such pain.
SHERLOCK
We’ll do everything we can. 
GIRL
I’m scared, I’m really -
Dialling tone cuts her off.
The countdown clock has competed, and disappears to be 
replaced by Eurus.
EURUS
(On screen)
Now. Back to the matter in hand... 
Coffin!!
They all look to the coffin, on the plinth.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERRINFORD - SPECIAL UNIT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eurus at her console.
EURUS
Problem: someone is about to die. 
It will be, as I understand it, a 
tragedy. So many days not lived, so 
many words unsaid, etc.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERRINFORD. BLACK ROOM - DAY
80B
80B
Sherlock’s gaze switches to the coffin. (We now intercut with 
Eurus as required.)
SHERLOCK
This, I presume, will be their 
coffin. 
EURUS
But whose coffin, Sherlock? Start 
your deductions. I will apply some 
context in a moment.
A beat. Sherlock steps to the coffin, scanning it.
SHERLOCK
Allowing for the entirely   
pointless courtesy of headroom, I’d 
say this coffin is intended for 
someone of about five foot four, 
which makes a woman more likely.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
88.


JOHN
Not a child?
SHERLOCK
A child’s coffin tends to be more 
expensive. This is in the lower 
price range, but the best available 
in that bracket. 
JOHN
Well, that was a lonely evening on 
Google.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
88A.


SHERLOCK
This is a practical and informed 
choice. The balance of probability 
is that this is for an unmarried 
woman, distant from her immediate 
family - again, suggested by the 
economy of the choice - acquainted 
with the processes of death, but 
unsentimental about the necessities 
of disposal. Additionally, the 
lining -
MYCROFT
Very good, Sherlock, but we could 
just look at the name on the lid.
He’s pointing to a coffin lid, propped against the opposite 
wall. There is a brass plate, not readable at this distance. 
They move closer.
Not a name engraved there - but three words. I LOVE YOU.
JOHN
So. It’s for somebody who loves 
somebody.
MYCROFT
It’s for somebody who loves 
Sherlock. 
(To Sherlock)
It’s all about you - everything 
here.
On Sherlock: registering that thought.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
So who loves you? I’m assuming it’s 
not a long list.
JOHN
Irene Adler?
Sherlock - has already worked it out, is haunted by the 
answer, hating it.
SHERLOCK
Don’t be ridiculous. Look at the 
coffin. Unmarried, practical about 
death, alone.
JOHN
(Heavily)
Molly.
SHERLOCK
Molly Hooper.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
89.


Screens flicker on all round the room. Various views of Molly 
Hooper’s flat, clearly from concealed cameras. Molly herself 
is pottering around.
EURUS
She’s perfectly safe. For the 
moment. Her flat is rigged to 
explode in approximately three 
minutes. Unless I hear the release 
code from her lips. Phone her, 
Sherlock. Make her say it.
JOHN
Say what?
EURUS
Obvious, surely.
JOHN
No.
SHERLOCK
Yes.
He points to the brass plate on the coffin lid. I LOVE YOU.
Sherlock already has his phone out, is tapping away.
EURUS
One important restriction. You’re 
not allowed to mention, in any way 
at all, that her life is in danger. 
You may not, at any point, suggest 
that there is any form of crisis. 
If you do, I will end this session, 
and her life. Are we clear?
Sherlock: oh christ, more games. But surely this is possible.
TANNOY MORIARTY
Tick tock! Tick tock!
On screen, Molly, in her kitchen - she’s by the kettle, 
waiting for it to boil. She turns her head, hearing her phone 
ring -

Molly glances over to where his phone is - on the table, at 
the other side of the kitchen. She moves towards it -

The kettle has boiled. She turns back, decides to make the 
tea first!
CUT TO:
INT. SHERRINFORD - BLACK ROOM - DAY
82

Sherlock, Mycroft and John watching in despair. (Intercut as 
required.)
SHERLOCK
What’s she doing?
MYCROFT
She’s making tea.
SHERLOCK
Why isn’t she answering the phone??
JOHN
You never answer your phone.
SHERLOCK
But it’s me calling.
TANNOY MORIARTY
Tick tock! Tick tock!
On Molly. She’s looking a little moody, a little bored - like 
this is not a good day, and when she’s alone she doesn’t have 
to hide that. She’s going into her laborious, habitual 
routine of tea-making. Squeezing the bag. Adding the milk. 
In Sherlock’s ear, the phone goes to answerphone.
MOLLY ON ANSWERPHONE
Hi. This is Molly at the dead 
centre of town, ha ha! Leave a 
message.
A tired beep.
Sherlock cuts off the call, goes straight to Call Again.
TANNOY MORIARTY
Tick tock! Tick Tock!
Molly, finishing up on her tea. Tries a sip. Her phone starts 
ringing again. She gives it a desultory glance, adds a little 
more milk to her tea.
Sherlock and the others watching: for Christ’s sake.
JOHN
Jesus ...
And now Molly, with some resignation heads to the phone -
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
91.


On the three of them: finally!
Molly picks the phone up, checks who it is.
A beat as she looks at the name. Too long a beat.
On the three of them: what??
Molly seems to sag. Oh God, him! Oh, please, not today.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Molly, answer it. Bloody answer it.
- a suspended moment. Molly deciding, her life in the balance
- and finally, she clicks it.
MOLLY
Hello, Sherlock. Is this urgent, 
because I’m not having a good day.
Sherlock, visibly collecting himself. So little time, no 
second chances.
SHERLOCK
(Quickly, calmly)
Molly, I need you to do something 
very simple for me, and not ask me 
why.
MOLLY
Oh God, if this one of your stupid 
games -
SHERLOCK
It’s not a game, I just need you to 
... help me.
MOLLY
I’m not at the lab.
SHERLOCK
It’s not about that -
MOLLY
Well quickly then, and just this 
once, don’t make fun of me.
On Sherlock: silenced for a moment, what the hell does he 
say?
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Well, what is it? What do you want?
TANNOY MORIARTY
Tick tock!
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
92.


SHERLOCK
... Molly ... please, without 
asking why, just say these words 
...
MOLLY
What words?
SHERLOCK
... I love you.
On Molly. Her face filling with fury. He’s taking the mickey! 
MOLLY
Oh, piss off.
She goes to click the phone off.
SHERLOCK
Molly, no, please no, don’t hang 
up! Do not hang up!!
EURUS
Calmly, Sherlock. Or I’ll finish 
her right now. 
MOLLY
Why do you do this? Why do you make 
fun of me? Why always me??
SHERLOCK
(Trying to clamp down his 
his stress)
Please, I swear, you just have to 
listen to me -
EURUS
Softer, Sherlock. Crisis? What 
crisis? 
Sherlock: willing his voice to calm.
SHERLOCK
Molly. This is just a case. A sort 
of ... experiment 
MOLLY
I’m not an experiment, Sherlock! 
SHERLOCK
Of course you’re not. You’re my 
friend - we’re friends. But please, 
I just need you to say those words.
MOLLY
Please, don’t do this. Just don’t 
do this.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
93.


SHERLOCK
It’s important - I can’t explain 
why, but I promise it is.
MOLLY
... I can’t say that. I can’t say 
that to you.
SHERLOCK
Of course you can. Why can’t you?
MOLLY
You know why. 
SHERLOCK
I do not know why.
MOLLY
Of course you know.
EURUS
Final thirty seconds.
TANNOY MORIARTY
Tick tick tick tick tick tick tick!
All the other screens, apart from the one Molly is on, go to 
countdown clocks. The last thirty seconds.
SHERLOCK
Just, please, say it.
MOLLY
I can’t. Not to you!
SHERLOCK
Why?
A beat: Molly, nowhere else to go but to tell the truth.
MOLLY
Because it’s true. Because it’s 
true, Sherlock, it’s always been 
true.
On Sherlock: so little time. His face freezes.
SHERLOCK
(As icy as we’ve seen him)
If it is true ... say it anyway.
On Molly: reeling at his cruelty. 
MOLLY
You bastard.
SHERLOCK
Say it anyway.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

The clock: fifteen seconds!
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
94A.


MOLLY
(Raging now)
You say it. Go on, you say it 
first. 
SHERLOCK
... what?
MOLLY
Say it, Sherlock. Say it like you 
mean it.
Ten seconds, the time flicking away.
On Sherlock: calming himself, making it count.
SHERLOCK
I love you.
On Molly: those words from that man. Poleaxed. Tears. Can’t 
speak.
Seconds ticking away.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Molly ...
(Nothing)
Molly, please!
The hand of clock flicking through the last few seconds -
- the last possible moment, and -
MOLLY
I love you.
And it’s horribly, hugely true. And just in time. The screens 
go blank.
On Sherlock: wrung out. If he ever thought he didn’t have 
emotions, he’s learned better now. 
John and Mycroft - hardly knowing what to say, whether they 
should say anything.
MYCROFT
Sherlock - what you just did, 
however hard it was -
SHERLOCK
(Cutting across him, full 
of fury)
Eurus, I won. I won, I saved her. 
Where’s my prize. 
(Silence)
Come on, play fair. The girl on the 
plane, I need to talk to her!
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
95.
(MORE)


(Silence)
I won! I saved Molly Hooper.
The screen flares back on. Eurus.
EURUS
Saved her? From what? Oh, be 
sensible - there were no explosives 
in her little house, why would I be 
so clumsy. You didn’t win - you 
lost. Look what you did to her. And 
look what you did to yourself. All 
those complicated emotions - I lost 
count! Emotional context, Sherlock - 
it destroys you every time. Now 
please pull yourself together, I 
need you at peak efficiency - the 
next one isn’t going to be so easy.
The door to the next room opens.
EURUS (CONT’D)
In your own time...
John and Mycroft wearily plod towards the door -
- but now John looks back. Sherlock, not moving. 
JOHN
Sherlock?
Sherlock walks calmly over to the coffin -
- and with a great bellow of rage, kicks it over. Now 
smashing it to pieces. Rage and violence, unstoppable. 
Stamping on the shattered wood. It goes on and on ...
Mycroft and John watching.
Craning up from Sherlock, as he rages and whirls and smashes -

SHERLOCK (CONT'D)


JOHN
I know it’s difficult, but you’ve 
got to keep it together. She’s 
torturing you.
SHERLOCK
This isn’t torture, it’s 
vivisection. We are witnessing 
science from the perspective of a 
lab rat.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(A beat; smiles)
Soldiers?
JOHN
Soldiers.
John helps him up. On this, as if responding to the return to 
action.
Sherlock leads the way through. As they head through the

A cell like the others, but quite empty - except for the

I told you you’d need it. Because 
only two can play at the next game. 
Sherlock, John and Mycroft exhausted, exchanging glances. 
What the hell does she mean now?
EURUS (CONT’D)
Just two of you go on from here. 
Your choice. It’s make your mind up 
time. Whose help do you need the 
most - John or Mycroft? 
SHERLOCK
Why do I need the gun?
EURUS
It’s an elimination round. You 
choose one - and kill the other.
A terrible silence. 
EURUS (CONT’D)
You have to choose. Family or 
friend. Mycroft or John Watson.

She smiles. 
TANNOY MORIARTY
(Louder)
Tick! Tock!
On Sherlock: looking so defeated.
Mycroft, registering his brother’s condition. He now speaks 
to his sister.
MYCROFT
Eurus. Enough.
EURUS
Not yet, I think. But nearly.
The three men look at each other. 
Then - 
MYCROFT
Well?
SHERLOCK
Well what?
MYCROFT
(laughs)
We’re not actually going to discuss 
this, are we? 
(To John)
I’m sorry, Dr. Watson. You are a 
fine man in many respects.
(To Sherlock)
Make your goodbyes, and shoot him.
Beat. 
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Shoot him. 
JOHN
What?
MYCROFT
Shoot Dr. Watson! There’s no 
question of who has to continue. 
It’s us. You and me. Whatever lies 
ahead it requires brain power, 
Sherlock, not sentiment. Don’t 
prolong his agony - shoot him.
Sherlock looks at John. He is taking the gun from his belt.
JOHN
Hang on, don’t I get a bloody say 
in this?
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
98.


MYCROFT
Today we are soldiers. Soldiers die 
for their country. I regret, Dr. 
Watson, that privilege is now 
yours.
Sherlock, frowning, looking at the gun in his hand. 
JOHN
... shit. He’s right. He is, in 
fact, right.
MYCROFT
Make it swift. No need for him to 
suffer. Get it over with and we can 
get to work.  
But Sherlock doesn’t move.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Oh God. I might have expected this. 
Pathetic. Eurus is right. You 
always were the slow one. Always 
the idiot. And that’s why I’ve 
always despised you. You shame us 
all. You shame the family name. Now 
for once in your life do the right 
thing. Put this stupid little man 
out of all our misery. Shoot him!! 
SHERLOCK
(So softly)
Stop it.
MYCROFT
Look at him! What is he? Nothing 
more than a distraction. A little 
scrap of ordinariness for you to 
show off to and dazzle with your 
cleverness. You can find another.
SHERLOCK
Please, for God’s sake, stop it.
MYCROFT
Why?
SHERLOCK
Because, on balance, even your Lady 
Bracknell was more convincing.
Mycroft’s face flickers - exposed, so soon.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(To John)
Ignore everything he’s said. He’s 
being kind. He’s trying to make it 
easier for me to kill him.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
99.
(MORE)


(Raises his gun, aims it 
at Mycroft)
Which is going to make this so much 
harder.
A terrible silence. The two brothers. Eyes locked.
Mycroft looks at the gun, nods. Brave at the last.
MYCROFT
You said you liked my Lady 
Bracknell.
JOHN
... Sherlock ... don’t ...
MYCROFT
It’s not your decision, Dr. Watson.
(To Sherlock)
Not in the face, though, please. 
I’ve promised my brain to the Royal 
Society. 
SHERLOCK
(gently)
Where would you suggest?
MYCROFT
Well, I suppose there is a heart 
somewhere inside me. I don’t 
imagine it’s much of a target, but 
why don’t we try for that? No 
flowers. By request.
JOHN
No. I won’t allow this. You’re the 
smart one, you’re the right soldier 
for this mission.
MYCROFT
I was never the right soldier. This 
is my fault.
(To Sherlock)
Moriarty.
SHERLOCK
... what?
MYCROFT
Her Christmas treat. Five minutes 
conversation with Jim Moriarty, 
five years ago.
SHERLOCK
What did they say.
Mycroft swallows hard. The hardest admission.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)


MYCROFT
Five minutes conversation ... 
unsupervised.
On Sherlock: this is almost enough to make him pull the 
trigger.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Good bye, brother mine. For the 
greater good. 
Sherlock standing there, the gun leveled.
EURUS
This is very interesting. Jim 
Moriarty thought you’d make this 
choice - he was very excited.
TANNOY MORIARTY
And here we are, the end of the 
line. Holmes killing Holmes. This 
is where I get off.
On Sherlock: the voice of his hated enemy. Finally, it’s too 
much.
SHERLOCK
Five minutes. It took five minutes 
for her to do this to all of us. 
Well. Not on my watch.
And very deliberately he lowers the gun.
EURUS
What are you doing?
SHERLOCK
A few minutes ago a very brave man 
asked to be remembered. 
(Places the gun under his 
own chin)
I’m remembering the governor. 10 
... 9 ... 8 ...
EURUS
Oh, Sherlock you can’t - you don’t 
know about Redbeard yet.
SHERLOCK
7 ... 6 ... 5 ...
EURUS
Sherlock, stop that at once!!
A pfft noise. Sherlock’s hand slaps to his neck
There’s a dart.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

Sherlock starts to reel, his legs buckling, grimly keeps 
counting.
SHERLOCK

THE GIRL

Hello?
Darkness. 
SHERLOCK opens his eyes a fraction. Gradually focuses.
There’s a single light - warm, yellowy. 
He’s sitting in the middle of another Sherrinford cell. This 
one is stained, older-looking, the walls black with damp. 
On a metal table: an old fashioned lantern, its flame 
sputtering. 
Sherlock rubs his face. Groans.
THE GIRL (V.O.)
Hello, please, are you still there?
How can he hear her? He puts a hand to his head - he’s 
wearing an earpiece.
SHERLOCK
Yes. I’m here. 
THE GIRL (V.O.)
You went away. You said you’d help 
me and you went away. 
SHERLOCK
I’m sorry. We...we were cut off. 
How long was I away?
THE GIRL
Hours! Hours and hours!
Sherlock is immediately alert. Fuck!!
CUT TO:

The Girl looks forlorn. The plane rattles and rocks around 
her. (We now intercut with the cell.)
THE GIRL 
Why don’t grown ups tell the truth? 
She cries softly. 
SHERLOCK
I am telling the truth. You can 
trust me. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
102.


THE GIRL
Where did you go?
SHERLOCK
I’m not completely sure!
SHERLOCK picks up the candle and sweeps it round the darkened 
cell. 
Pasted all over the walls, photograph after photograph. Young 
Sherlock, young Mycroft, Mr and Mrs Holmes. But no Eurus...
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Okay. Now you’re going to have to 
be very brave. I need you to go to 
the front of the plane, ok?
THE GIRL
The front? 
SHERLOCK
Yes. 
THE GIRL
You mean where the driver is? 
SHERLOCK
That’s right.
THE GIRL
Ok. I’m going.
Sherlock moves over to the wall. 
There’s a small window in the cell. Beyond - a looming 
darkness, lights disappearing into the distance. 
SHERLOCK
Are you there? 
Beat. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Are you there yet?
Beat. 
JOHN (V.O.)
I’m here. 
SHERLOCK
John??
JOHN (V.O.)
Yes. 
SHERLOCK
Where are you?
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

JOHN (V.O.)
Don’t know. It’s totally dark, I 
just woke up. Where are you?
SHERLOCK
Another cell. I was talking to the 
girl on the plane again - we’ve 
been out for hours.
JOHN (V.O.)
She’s still up there?
SHERLOCK
Yes. Can you make out anything at 
all? Is Mycroft with you?
CUT TO:
INT. WELL - NIGHT.

With JOHN. 
Hardly a glimmer of light. Just dankness. The dripping of 
water. Intercut with Sherlock.
JOHN 
I don’t think so. There’s no light. 
(Calling out)
Mycroft? Mycroft?
No answer.
SHERLOCK 
Are you ok?
JOHN 
I’m ok. 
SHERLOCK
Keep exploring. Tell me everything 
you can about where you are. 
John feels around.
JOHN 
The walls are rough. Rock. And wet. 
Beat. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
That was...brave. 
SHERLOCK 
What was?
JOHN 
What you did back there. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16
104.


SHERLOCK
The only logical approach. What are 
you standing on?
JOHN 
Stone, I think. But there’s about 
six inches of water. You couldn’t 
kill your brother. 
SHERLOCK
There was no need. 
JOHN 
But you couldn’t do it. You 
couldn’t shoot him. 
CUT TO:
INT. CELL - NIGHT.

SHERLOCK
That wasn’t the issue. This is all 
about me. All for my benefit. Stage 
managed. Showbiz.
He gets down on the floor with the candle, peers at the point 
where the wall joins the floor.  
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
If I threatened to take myself out 
of the picture, Eurus wouldn’t have 
her game. It was a chain of pure 
reasoning. And also...
Beat. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I couldn’t kill him. 
This is a moment. A revelation. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
But that doesn’t mean Eurus hasn’t. 
Anything else there?
JOHN (V.O.)
Chains. 
(heavily)
My feet are chained up. And -

Yes?
JOHN
I can feel something else.

SHERLOCK peers into the shadows. He sees...

childish writing - REDBEARD.
SHERLOCK
Redbeard...
THE GIRL (V.O.)
Who’s Redbeard?
The Girl’s back.

THE GIRL 
Yes. But I still can’t wake the 
driver. 
The Girl is in the cockpit. The two pilots are slumped in 
their seats. 
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
That’s ok. What can you see now?
Blazing through the window - London at night! The bomber’s 
view, the snaking river.
THE GIRL
I can see a river. There’s a big 
wheel.

This impacts on Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
Okay. We’re going to drive the 
plane, you and me.
THE GIRL
We are? 
SHERLOCK
Yeah. There’s nothing to it. Now, 
we need to get in touch with 
someone on the ground. Can you see 
anything that looks like a radio?
The Girl looks at the baffling controls. 
THE GIRL
No.
SHERLOCK
Okay, keep looking. We’ve got 
plenty of time. 
The girl screams as the plane judders and shakes.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
What’s wrong?
THE GIRL
The whole plane is shaking.
SHERLOCK
That’s turbulence, nothing to worry 
about.
THE GIRL
My ears hurt.
SHERLOCK
Right. Does it look like the 
river’s getting close.
THE GIRL
A little bit.
SHERLOCK
Right then. You’re nearly home.
We just need to talk to some people 
on the ground. Then we can get you 
down safely, alright?
Beat. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Hello? 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

JOHN (V.O.)
I think I’m in a well.
SHERLOCK
John?
JOHN (V.O.)
That’s where I am. The bottom of a 
well. 
SHERLOCK
Ding-dong-dell...
JOHN (V.O.)
Don’t even go there. 
SHERLOCK
Why would there be a well in 
Sherrinford.
JOHN
Well it’s an old building ...
He sweeps up the lantern and illuminates the walls. 
SHERLOCK
The lantern’s flickering. Why? 
There’s air getting in, here at the 
back, where there shouldn’t be any 
draft. 
He peers into the shadowed corner of the cell. Just visible, 
a crack of light.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
There’s light bleeding in too. 
The cell walls don’t meet up 
properly. 
He drops to his knees.
Sherlock vision: a small painted line on the floor just in 
front of the wall.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Walls don’t contract after they’ve 
been painted. Not real ones, 
anyway.
JOHN (V.O.)
What are you talking about?
He walks over to the wall, places his hands flat on it. And 
pushes.
The wall just falls ...

Pull back to reveal the cell is a set standing in moonlight, 
He’s outside somewhere.
SHERLOCK moves round to the side. The ‘view’ through the 
window is in fact a frame in false perspective, smaller and 
smaller lights disappearing into the dark. 
Angrily, he pushes the frame over. 
SHERLOCK
(shouting)
Eurus, enough of this. There’s a 
plane about to crash on London. You 
wouldn’t be teasing if there wasn’t 
a chance I could stop it. Tell me 
what you want. Tell me!
As speaks, he’s stepped from the cell, looked round. And now 
breaks off staring. Oh God! Oh God!
JOHN (V.O.)
Sherlock? What’s happened? Where 
are you? 
SHERLOCK
(awed)
I’m home. 
Beat. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
This is Musgrave Hall! 
Hero shot: sinister in the moonlight before him, Musgrave 
Hall, the family home of the Holmes!
From the earpiece, Eurus’ voice -
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

EURUS (O.S.)
Me and Jim Moriarty - we got on 
like a house on fire. Which 
reminded me of home, of course. 
This old place! 
SHERLOCK
(Striding towards the 
hall)
Yeah, I don’t care, it’s just an 
old building. The plane, tell me 
about the plane, now!
EURUS (O.S.)
Sweet Jim, he was never very 
interested in being alive. 
Especially if he could make more 
trouble dead. 
CUT TO:
Flash!
Jim Moriarty’s video message: 
JIM
Miss me? 
CUT TO:
SHERLOCK
Yeah, still don’t care - the plane.
EURUS (O.S.)
You knew he’d take his revenge. His 
revenge, apparently, is me - and I 
don’t even know what revenge is.
Sherlock now at the door. Pushing his way through.

The same hallway we saw before, but desolate, darkened. A few

SHERLOCK
Please, listen to me. I need to 
talk to the girl on the plane, then 
I’ll play any game you like.
EURUS (O.S.)
First - find Redbeard!
And a huge bank of screens along the side of the wall blaze 
into life!
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

On the screens - lurid in green night vision - JOHN, at the 
bottom of a well. 
Sherlock’s eyes widen. 
EURUS (CONT’D)
I’m letting the water in now. You 
don’t want me to drown another of 
you pets, do you? At long last, 
Sherlock Holmes, it’s time to solve 
the Musgrave ritual. Your very 
first case. And the final problem. 
Bye bye!

He touches his hand to his ear-piece.

JOHN (V.O.)

SHERLOCK

On the monitor: JOHN, the water rising around him. 
The screen flickers and there’s EURUS.

John screws up his eyes against the unexpected light, taking 
in his predicament.
Water is trickling fast through the mottled brickwork. 
Intercut between John and Sherlock.
JOHN 
So there was a well? Near your

Sixteen feet by six. Sixteen

there was nothing. No-one.

corkscrew in human form.
JOHN
This time he’s been protecting you.

They’re not dog’s bones.

We stay on Eurus, losing the dog as she runs. As she circles 
past him again -
- suddenly Redbeard isn’t a dog any more.
He’s another little boy with bright ginger hair - VICTOR. 
Also wearing a pirate hat. His raises a wooden cutlass and 
roars -
VICTOR

treasure. Quick! Quick!

They’re oddly sharp.

You see how clever you are? Your

You’re above us all, alone in the

I can bring you home.

No. Too late now, too late. Every

Bit shaken up, that’s all. She 
didn’t hurt him - just locked him 
in her old cell.
JOHN
What goes around, comes around.
LESTRADE
Give me a moment, guys.
Sherlock stops him for a moment.
SHERLOCK
Mycroft. Make sure he’s looked 
after. He’s not as strong as he

LESTRADE
Fan, are you?
YOUNG POLICE OFFER
Well. He’s a great man, sir.
Lestrade looks over at Sherlock - just a hint of pride.
LESTRADE
No, he’s better than that. He’s a 
good one.
He heads to his squad car.
On Sherlock, looking sombre. He’s watching -
- Eurus, in handcuffs, being led towards a high security van.
Her head is lowered, there are tears on her face. She does 
not look over at Sherlock, or at anyone.
On Sherlock, troubled. Like this is unresolved...
Eurus entering the van. The van doors close, definitively.
JOHN
You okay?
Sherlock, not sure what to say for a moment. Then:
SHERLOCK
I said I’d bring her home. But I

you??
MYCROFT
I was trying to be ... kind.  
MRS HOLMES
Kind? Kind?? You told us our 
daughter was dead.
MYCROFT
Better that, than tell you what

Whatever she became, whatever she

Then you should have done better.
Mycroft, about to speak. Realises that’s crushingly right.

He did his best.

Well then, he’s very limited.
Mr Holmes turns to Sherlock.

Back in Sherrinford. Secure this 
time. People have died.

Without doubt, she will kill again 
if she has the opportunity. There 
is no possibility she will ever be 
able to leave.
MR HOLMES
When can we see her?
MYCROFT
There’s no point. 
MRS HOLMES
How dare you say that.
MYCROFT
She won’t talk. She won’t 
communicate with anyone, in any 
way. She has passed beyond our 
view. There are no words that can 
reach her now. 
Mrs Holmes looks at him coldly - her disappointing son. And 
looks to:
MRS HOLMES
Sherlock?
Sherlock looks up.
MRS HOLMES (CONT’D)
Well? You were always the grown-up.
On Sherlock: realising, to his own surprise, that that’s 
true. Mycroft, slightly lowering his acknowledging the same.
MRS HOLMES (CONT’D)
What do we do now?
On Sherlock’s face, thinking...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SHERRINFORD ISLAND. HELIPAD - DAY. 
131
131
A helicopter clatters over Sherrinford and lands. 
A beat - and SHERLOCK gets out. 
CUT TO:
INT. SHERRINFORD. CORRIDOR - DAY. 
132
132
SHERLOCK is escorted through the endless corridors. Deeper 
and deeper into Sherrinford. He is carrying a holdall.

INT. SHERRINFORD - EURUS’S CELL - DAY.
133
133
SHERLOCK reaches EURUS’ cell. The glass is very much in place 
this time. 
Eurus sits with her back to him. Silent. 
The tiniest turn of her head makes it clear that she knows 
he’s there - but she turns her head back. Not talking, not to 
anyone.
On Sherlock: unzipping the holdall.
On Euros: hears this, but still doesn’t turn.
Then, a violin being tuned, and plucked. Readied.
Still doesn’t turn.
Now the violin being playing. Something desperately sad. 
This goes on for a little while. Finally, without turning.
EURUS
Put your head back a little.
Music stops.
On Sherlock. Not even a smile, he just does as he’s told, 
resumes playing.
A little longer.
EURUS (CONT’D)
(Still not turning)
Your index finger is too loose on 
the grip.
Sherlock adjusts. Resumes.
EURUS (CONT’D)
No, from the beginning.
He starts again.
But now stands, turns, watches him.
EURUS (CONT’D)
Oh, Sherlock. You’re bowing a 
violin, not sawing wood.
He stops. Looks just a little sulky. Even defiant. Well if 
you’re so smart.
A standoff for a few beats -
- then Eurus goes to her violin, picks it up, plays a few 
achingly melancholy notes.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16

He responds with a few more notes.
She approves.
And together, teacher and pupil, they play their sad song.
The music continues over:
CUT TO:
INT. JOHN AND MARY’S HOUSE - DAY
134

John sorting through his post. A thick white envelope takes 
his attention.
CUT TO:
INT. JOHN AND MARY’S HOUSE - DAY
135

John on the phone.
JOHN
I think you’d better get round 
here.
Panning down to the contents of the envelope.
A DVD, with MISS YOU written on it.
CUT TO:
INT. JOHN AND MARY’S HOUSE - DAY
136

Sherlock and John in front of the TV, braced for something 
that’s going to be tough.
On the TV. Mary, she smiles.

CUT TO:
INT. EURUS’S CELL - DAY
137
137
Sherlock and Eurus, still playing. By their clothes, it’s 
another day. The music is still sad, but fuller now, more 
energetic. And they look at each other as they play. Teacher 
and pupil, still. She creates a phrase, he picks it up.

Mrs Hudson, delighted, as workman are hard at work, 
reclaiming the ruin. 
They’re having to work round Sherlock, who is in his (new but 
similar) chair, on his laptop. He’s talking to John, who is 
leaning over his shoulder - clearly they are on a case.
CUT TO:
INT. EURUS’S CELL - DAY

Another day, the two of them playing. The sadness is almost

Another day. The music speeding up, starting to soar, 
becoming recognisably the theme tune...
CUT TO:
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY
146
146
The flat is close to being the bare bones of what it was. The 
famous wallpaper is being hung.
John is already spray-painting the smiley face back where it 
should be. To one side, Sherlock is loading his gun. (A real 
sense they’re both enjoying themselves.)

The flat is back - tidier than we’re used to, but it’s all 
there. A ceremonial moment - John holds a letter on the 
mantel, and Sherlock slams a dagger into it. Mrs Hudson looks 
pained.

Another day. Sherlock and Eurus, closer now, smiling. They’re 
playing the Sherlock action theme, fast and furious.

The best and wisest men I have ever

INT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY

A blizzard of cases in one 360 shot. The ventriloquist 
client. A blackboard covered in dancing men. A dead Viking 
lying on the floor, as Sherlock and John examine him, and Mrs 
Hudson looking on in disgust, worrying about her carpets. 
John unwrapping a handkerchief to reveal a severed thumb. He 
quickly whisks it away from a grasping child’s hand. Rosie, 
no a toddler, stumbles away towards Sherlock, who is clearly 
teaching her to walk (”Well done, very good!”) Now Lestrade 
stumbling through the door, clearly in a crisis, beckoning 
them to follow. He races out again, revealing Molly is with 
him.

Sherlock and Eurus - the Sherlock theme, fast, furious, 
joyous!!
We’re circling them now, as the music plays -
- slowly bringing into shot, Mr and Mrs Holmes, sitting a 
little distance behind Sherlock, listening to their children 
play, tears streaming down their faces. Mrs Holmes puts her 
hand out - and squeezes Mycroft’s hand, who we now reveal is 
also sitting there. The Holmes family, together at last.
