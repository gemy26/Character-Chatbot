EXT. CEMETERY. DAY.

1
A stark black gravestone. Dead flowers wilted round the 
base, messages scrawled on damp cards. The ink has run. 
It’s like a shrine.
The stone’s a bit grubby but the name in gold letters is 
unmistakable -
SHERLOCK HOLMES
A shadow falls across it...
JOHN (V.O.)
Sherlock!!
CUT TO:
EXT. BART’S HOSPITAL ROOF. DAY.

...flashback... 
SHERLOCK, phone in hand, stands on the roof of Bart’s. 
Below him, PASSERS-BY, a red phone-box, a parked laundry 
van...
SHERLOCK 
(into phone)
It’s a trick. Just a magic trick. 
CUT TO:
Behind him, the dead body of JIM still lies, blood pooling 
around his shattered head.
CUT TO:
JOHN
No. Alright stop it now.
John takes a step into the road. 
SHERLOCK
No. Stay exactly where you are. 
Don’t move.
JOHN
Alright.
SHERLOCK
Keep your eyes fixed on me. 
Please would you do this for me. 
JOHN
Do what?

SHERLOCK
This phone call. It’s my note. 
That’s what people do, don’t it? 
Leave a note?
JOHN
Leave a note when?
SHERLOCK
Goodbye, John. 
JOHN
No. Don’t!
And Sherlock throws himself from the roof...
JOHN (CONT’D)
Sherlock!!  
John rushes across the street - and a CYCLIST slams into 
him. John’s hurled to the tarmac. The cyclist doesn’t stop.
John doesn’t see what happens next...
CUT TO:
INT. BART’S HOSPITAL. DAY.

Two MEN in black fatigues manhandle JIM’s corpse into a 
lift. Fast, ‘Mission Impossible’ style cuts.
CUT TO:
CLOSE on a contact lens holder. One of the MEN removes a 
lens with a pair of tweezers.
CUT TO:
They open a case. Inside - a prosthetic SHERLOCK mask!
CUT TO:
They pull the mask over JIM’s dead face!
CUT TO:
EXT. BART’S HOSPITAL. DAY.

SHERLOCK falls towards the pavement - a blur of windmilling
arms -- but then he’s jerked back up by a bungee rope 
attached to his waist!
John is still sprawled, disorientated on the road.

INT. BART’S HOSPITAL. DAY.

SMASH!! SHERLOCK crashes through a window, still attached 
to the bungee.
MOLLY HOOPER is waiting for him on the other side. With 
Bond-like nonchalance, he disconnects his harness, kisses 
her on the mouth and saunters off into the corridor beyond.  
CUT TO:
EXT. BART’S HOSPITAL. DAY.

6
The two MEN appear from inside Bart’s, carrying JIM’s 
corpse, now dressed identically to Sherlock. They position 
him onto the pavement. Slapping at his suit makes blood-
bags burst all over his body. PASSERS-BY suddenly spring 
into action, flocking around him like a shield.
CUT TO:
Disorientated, John gets up.
Someone marches towards him in a hooded Parka.
John’s POV. We see it is -
DERREN BROWN! 
He grabs John by the shoulders and, with a nod, puts him 
under hypnosis. John’s head sinks onto his breast. Quickly 
Derren slips off John’s watch and adjusts the time, then 
gently lays John out onto the pavement again. He whispers 
in John’s ear and then disappears into the crowd.
John’s POV as he comes out of his trance and gets up. It’s 
as if he’s underwater. Sound, images, all distorted. 
People try to help John but he pushes them away. It’s like 
slo-mo. He staggers towards the broken body of his friend 
and fights off others as he takes the fake Sherlock’s 
pulse. Nothing. 
The gurney, with fake-Sherlock on it, is whisked into the 
hospital.
Devastated, John just stands there. 
The rain falls like angels’ tears onto this scene of aching 
melancholy --
LESTRADE (V.O.)
Bollocks.

EXT. HIGH COURT. COFFEE STALL. DAY.

LESTRADE is outside the High Court with ANDERSON. They  
cradle cups of coffee. 
ANDERSON 
No, no, no! It’s obvious. That’s 
how he did it! It’s obvious!
LESTRADE
Derren Brown? 
Anderson is sweating, dishevelled. There are TV news crews 
buzzing all over the steps. 
LESTRADE
Let it go! Sherlock’s dead. 
ANDERSON
Is he? 
LESTRADE
There was a body. It was him. 
Definitely him. Molly Hooper laid 
him out! 
ANDERSON
She’s lying! It was Jim 
Moriarty’s body. With a mask on.
LESTRADE 
A mask! A bungee rope, a mask and 
Derren Brown. Two years and the 
theories keep getting more 
stupid. How many more you got for 
me today? 
ANDERSON
Well - did you know all the 
paving slabs in that area, 
including the exact ones he 
landed on, are all -
LESTRADE
Guilt! That’s all this is. You 
pushed us all into thinking 
Sherlock was a fraud. You and 
Donovan. You did this, and it 
killed him, and he’s staying 
dead. Do you honestly believe if 
you have enough stupid theories 
it will change what really 
happened.
A beat on Anderson. Then genuine emotion, tightly reined 
in.

ANDERSON
I believe in Sherlock Holmes.
LESTRADE
That won’t bring him back.
A beat on Anderson. Almost mutinous. Cos he’s thinking yes, 
it will!
Lestrade glances over at the TV news crews. 
CUT TO:
TV SCREEN.

LIVE NEWS FEED. STRAPLINE: ‘SUICIDE DETECTIVE CLEARED.’

REPORTER 2
...uproar in court as Sherlock 
Holmes vindicated and cleared of 
all suspicion.
REPORTER 3
Sadly, all this comes too late 
for the detective who became 
something of a celebrity two 
years ago...
LESTRADE raises his coffee cup.
LESTRADE
Well then. Absent friends.
Lestrade gives him a beady look. With a sigh he joins the 
toast.
LESTRADE AND ANDERSON
Sherlock.
They ‘clink’ cups.
LESTRADE
God rest his soul.

Reflected in the black granite of Sherlock’s gravestone: a 
lonely figure. 
JOHN WATSON. A little older - and with a moustache! He 
gazes down sadly at Sherlock’s grave. 
Solitary. Abandoned.  
Or is he?
CUT TO:
CLOSE on John’s left hand. And another, female hand slips 
into his. 
CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST. NIGHT.

A helicopter searchlight sweeps over a dense, dark forest. 
Someone is running, panting hard. 
CUT TO:
POV: 
Tree trunks loom up starkly, like bony fingers pushing 
their way out of the grave. 
The helicopter clatters overhead. 
Dogs bark. Pursuing. Warning signs in Cyrillic script are 
everywhere.
The runner pelts on, dodging through the trees.
He stops to get his breath. The spotlight flickers by the 
trees, bleaching them out. But, at last, the clatter of the 
rotor blades and the barking of the dogs recedes. 
In the darkness, there’s only the exhausted panting of the 
runner. 
He turns.
POV shot: A burly SOLDIER slams the butt of his rifle 
towards the lens. 
Blackout.

INT. INTERROGATION HUT. ANTECHAMBER. NIGHT.
12
12
A dimly lit, grim military compound. Close on a very young 
SOLDIER in the uniform of an East European power, iPhone
buds in his ears, bopping gently to a dance track. He’s 
outside a rusting metal door.
Suddenly from the other side of the door-
SMACK! 
- bone against bone.
SMACK!
Someone gasps in pain.
On-screen subtitles of a TORTURER’s voice:
TORTURER
We can go on all night. We’re 
very patient. 
SMACK!
A yell of agony.
The young Soldier fiddles with his iPhone and turns up the 
dance track till it drowns out the sound of torture... 
CUT TO:
INT. INTERROGATION HUT. NIGHT.
13
13
The other side of the door is lit only by a bare bulb. 
There are three men in the room. 
One is the thick-necked and massive TORTURER. The second is 
an OFFICIAL in a massive greatcoat, lapels turned up, 
calmly watching as his friend lays into their PRISONER. 
In the ghastly light we see the Prisoner is almost naked 
and covered in bruises, his arms manacled and fixed to the 
ceiling by chains. His head is sunk on his chest and his 
very long, sweat-soaked hair completely obscures his face. 
TORTURER
(Serbian subtitles)
You broke in here for a reason. 
Just tell us why and you can 
sleep. Remember sleep? 
No response.
The Torturer reaches round and produces a baseball bat. He 
raises it high in the air, setting the bulb swinging.

(CONTINUED)


Suddenly, the Prisoner mumbles something.
The thick-necked TORTURER stops and leans in. 
TORTURER
What? 
The prisoner mumbles again. The torturer leans closer. 
Listens. Then he straightens up, frowning. 
OFFICIAL
Well? What did he say? 
TORTURER
He said...
OFFICIAL
Yes?
TORTURER
He said that I used to serve in 
the navy where I had an unhappy 
love affair.
OFFICIAL
What?
TORTURER
...that the electricity isn’t 
working in my bathroom and that 
my wife is sleeping with our next 
door neighbour -
The Prisoner mumbles again. The torturer leans in. 
TORTURER
- the coffin maker.
Mumble.
TORTURER
And...and...
Mumble. 
TORTURER
...if I get home now, I will 
catch them at it! 
He exchanges a furious look with the Official.
TORTURER
I knew it! I knew there was 
something going on!
He tears out of the hut. The door slams shut.

The Official contemplates the Prisoner, whose head remains 
bowed. 
OFFICIAL
So, my friend. Now it’s just you 
and me.
The door swings open and the Torturer darts back inside, 
grabs the baseball bat and exits again. 
OFFICIAL
(to Prisoner)
You have no idea the trouble it 
took to find you. 
He walks slowly up to the Prisoner and grabs his long hair. 
Then he leans in very close to the Prisoner’s ear. 
Unexpectedly, he speaks in English. 
OFFICIAL
(sotto)
Now listen to me. There’s an 
underground terrorist network 
active in London and a massive 
attack is imminent. Sorry, but 
the holiday is over ... 
Unexpectedly, he lets go of the Prisoner’s hair.
OFFICIAL
...brother dear. 
The Official pulls down the lapels of his greatcoat. 
Smiles. And suddenly we realise --
MYCROFT
Back to Baker Street, Sherlock 
Holmes!
The Prisoner slowly, slowly raises his head. Through the 
tangled mass of hair all we see is a half-smile.
SLAM!

OPENING TITLES.

A familiar silhouette in a dark coat. 
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
I need to get to know London again. 
Breathe it in. Every quiver of its 
beating heart. 
CLOSE on a smart  phone. A series of photos of random-seeming 
men and women, thumbed through on the screen.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
Sometimes it’s not a question of 
‘who’. It’s a question of ‘who 
knows’. 
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET. DAY.
15A
15A
A BURLY MAN looks round as he gets into his car.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
If this man cancels his papers...
A HOMELESS WOMAN sits nearby. Unexpectedly, she takes out a 
very expensive-looking smartphone.
Snap! She takes the man’s photo. Sends it.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
I need to know...
CUT TO:
EXT. MARKET. DAY.
15B
15B
A SLENDER WOMAN is shopping at a busy market. She has a 
beautiful pedigree dog on a lead.  
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
If this woman leaves London without 
putting her dog into kennels. I 
need to know...
Close by sits a HOMELESS MAN. He watches her with interest 
and then discreetly takes a photo and sends it.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
There are certain people. They’re 
markers. If they start to move, 
I’ll know something’s up. Like rats 
deserting a sinking ship.
MYCROFT (V.O.)
Markers of what?

...merging with a Tube train as it streaks through a 
station. JOHN trundles along in a half-empty compartment, 
lost in thought.
CUT TO:
EXT. LONDON STREET. DAY.

16A
A big, impressive black car speeds through London. Through 
its windows, a glimpse of a tangle-haired SHERLOCK.
CUT TO:
EXT. BAKER STREET. DAY.
17

JOHN stands opposite 221B. A couple of sulky KIDS go past, 
wheeling a poorly made Guy Fawkes in a push chair. It’s 
just a bundle of clothes with a balloon for a face. 
KID
Penny for the guy, mate? 
John just looks through them. Then gathers himself. It’s 
been a while. He goes up to the familiar door and lets 
himself in. 
CUT TO:

The car draws up outside an imposing Government building. 
CUT TO:
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. HALLWAY. DAY.

JOHN hesitates in the hallway, rolling the keys in his 
hands. He looks up at the seventeen steps. So many 
memories. Voices from the past...
JOHN (V.O.)
That was the most ridiculous 
thing I’ve ever done.

SHERLOCK (V.O.)
And you invaded Afghanistan. 
He smiles but then sadness clouds his face. 
Suddenly, the door to 221A opens and MRS HUDSON appears. 
She’s heard the key in the lock. John freezes. Mrs Hudson 
sees him. 
John gives a tiny, slightly sheepish wave. 
CUT TO:
INT. CELL. DAY.
18A
18A
A bleak cell. 
In a chair, an unkempt figure in fatigues, reading a paper. 
Headline: ‘Skeleton mystery baffles police’. 
SHERLOCK’s hair has been trimmed and a BARBER is busy giving 
him a cut-throat shave. MYCROFT stands in the shadows, 
consulting a file. 
MYCROFT
You have been busy.
SHERLOCK
(shrugs)
Moriarty’s organization. Took me 
two years to dismantle it. 
MYCROFT
And you’re confidant you have? 
SHERLOCK
The Serbian side was the last piece 
of the puzzle. 
MYCROFT
Yes. You got yourself in deep there 
with Baron Maupertius. Quite a 
scheme. 
SHERLOCK
Colossal.
MYCROFT
Anyway. You’re safe now.  
Sherlock grunts. 
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
A small ‘thank you’ wouldn’t go 
amiss.

SHERLOCK
What for? 
MYCROFT
For wading in. In case you’ve 
forgotten, field work is not my 
natural milieu.
SHERLOCK
Wading in? You sat there and 
watched while he beat me to a pulp. 
MYCROFT
I got you out!
SHERLOCK
I got me out! Couldn’t you have 
intervened sooner?
MYCROFT
I couldn’t risk giving myself away, 
could I? That would have ruined 
everything. 
SHERLOCK
You were enjoying it!
MYCROFT
Nonsense. 
SHERLOCK
Definitely enjoying it!
MYCROFT
Listen, do you have any idea what 
it was like, Sherlock? Going 
undercover? Smuggling my way into 
their ranks like that? 
(shudders)
The noise. The people. 
Sherlock looks away. A grudging beat of acquiescence. 
SHERLOCK
Didn’t know you could speak 
Serbian. 
MYCROFT
I couldn’t. But the language has a 
Slavic root. Frequent Turkish and 
German loanwords.
(shrugs)
Took me a couple of hours.
SHERLOCK
You’re slipping.

Bang!
A cup and saucer are plonked gracelessly onto the kitchen 
table. 
JOHN watches as MRS HUDSON puts down milk, sugar and a 
plate of biscuits with just enough force to make it obvious 
she’s cross. John clears his throat to speak. Mrs Hudson 
takes back the sugar bowl. 
MRS HUDSON 
Oh no, you don’t take it do you?
JOHN
No. 
MRS HUDSON
You can forget a little thing 
like that. 
JOHN
Yes. 
MRS HUDSON
You can forget lots of little 
things. It seems. 
JOHN
Aha.
Awkward silence.

SHERLOCK is now in a very sharp suit. He checks himself in a

Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
I’ll find your underground terror 
cell, Mycroft. Just put me back in 
London. I need to get to know the 
place again. Breathe it in. Every 
quiver of its beating heart. 
ANTHEA
One of our men - Atchison - died 
getting this information to us. All 
the chatter, all the traffic 
concurs. There’s going to be a 
terrorist strike on London. A big 
one.
SHERLOCK
What about John Watson? 
MYCROFT
John?
SHERLOCK
Have you seen him? 
MYCROFT
(withering)
Oh yes. We meet up every Friday for 
fish and chips.
He nods to Anthea. She shows Sherlock a photo. 
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
I’ve kept a weather eye on him, of 
course. 
It’s of John - with the moustache. Anthea goes out. 
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
You haven’t been in touch at all? 
To prepare him?

No.

Mrs Hudson smiles sadly, softening.

The door to the old flat creaks open and JOHN is framed 
there. He looks wistful. MRS HUDSON appears behind him. The 
flat is exactly as it was but thick with dust. 
MRS HUDSON
I couldn’t face letting it out. 
She bustles inside and draws the curtains. 
MRS HUDSON (CONT’D)
He never liked me dusting...

Mrs Hudson’s face falls.

Oh God. Is it serious? 
JOHN
What? No, I’m not ill. 
I’ve...well, I’m moving on. 
MRS HUDSON
You’re emigrating? 
JOHN
No. I mean I’ve met someone. 
MRS HUDSON
(thrilled)
Oh! Oh, how lovely!
JOHN
Yes. We’re getting married. Well, 
I’m going to ask, anyway.
MRS HUDSON
So soon after Sherlock?

Well. Yes. 
Mrs Hudson beams.

MYCROFT
He has a dinner reservation at a 
place called ‘Adair’s’. Nice little 
spot. They have a few bottles of 
the 2000 Bordeaux. Though I prefer 
the 2001...
SHERLOCK
Then I’ll pop in and see him.
MYCROFT
You know, it’s just possible that 
you might not be welcome.

JOHN sits alone at a table, very smartly dressed. He 
glances nervously at his watch and gulps down a large glass 
of water. Goes back to the menu he’s been looking at.
Wider: the POV of someone watching!
Sherlock Holmes stands just inside the restaurant. He’s in 
his usual dark suit, and white shirt, and is now pulling 
off his coat, ready to hang it up.
The Maitre D is already next to him.

Sir, can I help you?

The faintest of beeps.
SHERLOCK
Your wife just texted you - 
possibly her contractions have 
started.
The Maitre D goes pale, starts scrabbling for his phone. 
Sherlock looks over at John. The path is clear. He takes a 
step towards him, opens his mouth to speak --
- and his nerve fails him a little.
John, sitting there, unaware that the shock of his life is 
walking towards him.
Sherlock pauses. 
Looks around. 
Right next to him, a Man sits at table, dressed in a 
tuxedo. 
Sherlock’s face: a plan.
(The following sequence is fast a smooth, possibly all in 
one fluid tracking shot.)
Sherlock casually reaches out, knocks over the Man’s wine 
glass spattering red wine over his shirt front -
- Sherlock is immediately fussing over him patting his 
shirt with napkin -
SHERLOCK
Oh, I’m terribly sorry, let me 
get something from the kitchen 
for that.
- as he moves smoothly away we see that he has removed the
Man’s black bow tie, which he is now fixing with inhuman
speed to his own collar -
- before he’s even finished, he passes another man who is 
just putting down his menu and taking off his reading 
glasses -
SHERLOCK
Are you ready to order, sir? 
Excellent, let me take that for 
you.
- and he promptly takes the slightly startled man’s menu
away from him -

- on Sherlock now slipping on this man’s reading glasses,
which he’s also taken -
- and now he places the menu in front of a woman who 
already has a menu and is reading from it -
SHERLOCK
Ma’am, you might prefer this 
menu, it’s completely identical.
- she looks startled at the other menu, and doesn’t see
Sherlock slip his hand into her handbag -
- Sherlock, now heading away from her, an eyebrow pencil in 
his hand, giving himself a tiny little moustache -
On John, still pondering the Menu.
Sherlock glides behind him, now in character, complete with 
French accent.
SHERLOCK
Sir, can I help you in any way? 
JOHN
Need a bottle of champagne. A 
good one.
SHERLOCK
These are all excellent vintages, 
sir.
John barely glance at him - like you do with a waiter.
JOHN
Not really my area. What do you 
suggest?
SHERLOCK
I don’t really think you can go 
wrong, sir. But if you would take 
my personal recommendation -
He hits the word personal hard, to make John look at him - 
but it’s still barely a glance. 
SHERLOCK
- the last one on the list is a
favourite of mine. You might say,
in fact, it is ...
(Removes his glasses, 
the big reveal)
... a face from the past!
But John doesn’t even look.

JOHN
Great, I’ll have that one.
SHERLOCK
It is familiar, yet has a quality 
of ... surprise.
A fleeting glance from John - doesn’t twig.
JOHN
Well. Surprise me.
SHERLOCK
I am certainly endeavouring to, 
sir.
He moves away.
John gulps more water. Then he takes a small box out of his 
jacket pocket and sets it on the table. Inside: a beautiful 
diamond ring. It glitters in the candle-light. 
MARY (O.S.)
Sorry that took so long! 
John rapidly stuffs the box back into his jacket.
MARY
Queue was unbelievable. 
MARY, a very striking woman in her 30s sits opposite him. 
MARY
You ok?
JOHN
Yes! Me? Yes. Fine. I’m fine. 
Mary smiles. She’s onto him. 
MARY
Now then. What was it you wanted 
to ask me? 
JOHN
Drink? Do you want a drink yet? 
MARY
I’m ok with water, thanks. 
JOHN
Right. 
MARY
So?

Right. Mary. Listen. I know it

MARY

Go on. 
JOHN
The last couple of years haven’t 
been easy for me. And meeting 
you...meeting you has been the 
best thing that could’ve possibly 
happened -
MARY
I agree. 
JOHN
What?
MARY
I agree. I’m the best thing that 
could’ve happened to you. 
(smiles)
Go on. 
JOHN
(emboldened)
Well. 
(clears his throat)
If you’ll have me, Mary...I 
mean...Could you see your way to 
?
Sherlock, sweeping in to the romantic moment, with a bottle 
of champagne.
SHERLOCK
Sir, I think this vintage will be 
exceptionally to your liking. It 
has all quality of the old, with 
all the colours of the new - 
JOHN
No, sorry, not now, please -
SHERLOCK
Like a familiar gaze from a crowd  
of strangers, one is suddenly 
aware of staring into the face of 
an old friend!

JOHN
Look, seriously could you just -

He comes to a dead halt. 
The waiter is Sherlock Holmes.
SHERLOCK
Interesting thing a tuxedo. Lends 
distinction to friends, anonymity 
to waiters.
And Time seems to stop. John doesn’t move. Just stares at 
Sherlock.
And stares. 
He stands up. 
MARY
John? John, what is it?
Tears spring to John’s eyes. 
He blinks. Blinks. 
SHERLOCK
Well. Short version. Not dead!!
John. Still just staring.
SHERLOCK
Bit mean, springing it on you 
like that. Could’ve given you a 
heart attack. Probably will. But 
in my defence, it was really 
funny. 
(A beat)
Okay. That wasn’t a great 
defence.
Mary looks at Sherlock. Her eyes widen.
MARY
Oh no. You’re ...
SHERLOCK
Oh yes. 
MARY

Oh my God!

Not quite.

MARY
But you died. You jumped off a

SHERLOCK
No. 
MARY
You’re dead!
SHERLOCK
No. I checked. Excuse me.
He takes Mary’s napkin, dabs it in Mary’s glass of water, 
wipes his moustache off.
SHERLOCK
(To John)
Does yours come off too?
And now a new emotion chases over John’s face: fury! 
MARY
Ohmygodohmygod! Do you have any 
idea what -
Suddenly, John grabs Sherlock by the collar and shunts him 
backwards --
SHERLOCK
John, I’m starting to realise I 
probably owe you some sort of 
apology....
JOHN slams SHERLOCK against the wall, panting like a bull.
MARY
John! John, keep calm -
JOHN
Two years! Two years! I thought...I 
thought...
(chokes up)
You were dead! And you’ve let me 
grieve. How? How could you do 
that?? How??
Sherlock spots a pile of food through the service hatch and 
grabs some. 
SHERLOCK
You must be starving. Chip? Have a 
chip!
John smashes the food away.

you’ll regret - one question! Let 
me ask you one question! 
John pauses, panting. Sherlock points to John’s moustache. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Are you really keeping that?
John smiles. 
The tension’s broken.
Then, with a bellow, he hurls Sherlock to the floor and piles 
on top of him! A childish scrap ensues.
Mary tries to prise them apart. Staff and customers pile in 
too, trying to drag the two men apart.

They’re now in a much less salubrious cafe. Sherlock’s

JOHN
I don’t care how you faked it, 
Sherlock! I want to know why.
SHERLOCK
Why? Because Moriarty had to be 
stopped -
Beat.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Ah. Why. As in....ah. Right. Yes. 
Why? That’s a little more 
difficult to explain. 
JOHN
(dangerously)
I’ve got all night. 
Sherlock clears his throat.
SHERLOCK
Actually, it was all my brother’s 
plan. 
JOHN
This was all Mycroft’s idea? 
MARY
Well, he’d need a confidante.
John gives her a look. 
MARY
Sorry. 
JOHN
(to Sherlock)
But Mycroft was the only one? The 
only one who knew?
Sherlock looks away.

Couple of others. But it was a 
very elaborate plan! It had to 
be! The first of the thirteen 
possibilities was -

The three of them are now inside a dirty-looking kebab

at Sherlock, then down at a paper on the counter. ‘Dead Hat 
‘Tec cleared’ (not a headline). Sherlock catches his eye, 
looks away, then looks sidelong at JOHN.

She doesn’t. 
JOHN

She doesn’t. 
John turns to Mary. She can’t hide the truth. 
JOHN
Oh brilliant!
MARY
Sorry, love. I didn’t know how to 
tell you -
JOHN
Yeah. I’ve missed all this! This 
is charming!
The Kebab Man looks worriedly at them. Is this going to 
kick off?
JOHN
(hissed whisper)
Just one word, Sherlock. That’s 
all I would have needed! One word 
to let me know you were alive. 
SHERLOCK
I’ve nearly been in touch so many 
times...but I was worried you 
might - you know - say something 
indiscreet-

Over-reacting? You fake your own

Shh!

large as bloody life -
SHERLOCK
Shhh!
John grabs him by the lapels. 
JOHN
But I’m not supposed to have a 
problem with that. Of course not! 
Because Sherlock Holmes thinks 
that’s a perfectly ok thing to 
do!

Mary winks at Sherlock then joins John in the cab.

Those things’ll kill you.
A familiar silhouette in the shadows.
Lestrade closes his eyes. A moment of revelation. Then he 
grins.

MRS HUDSON is washing up. She’s got the radio on.

With something this important, 
the Government feels duty-bound 
to push through the legislation 
with all due expedition...
She frowns as she hears something and turns down the radio. 
There’s the sound of a key in the front door.
She goes to the door of her flat and opens it. We see out 
into the hallway. SHERLOCK is framed in the open door.
We zoom into Mrs Hudson’s tonsils as she screeeeeeams!

It holds the phone in its hand.

SHERLOCK and JIM MORIARTY! 
Sherlock is speaking to John on another phone. 
SHERLOCK

This phone call. It’s my note. 
That’s what people do, don’t 
they? Leave a note?
JOHN (O.S.)
Leave a note when?

Goodbye, John. 
Jim giggles. Sherlock shushes him.

No. Don’t!

One wall of ANDERSON’s flat has been entirely converted 
into a massive crime board. Coloured string connects 
scrawled notes, photos and pieces of evidence. It’s like a 
botched version of Sherlock’s method. Everywhere we notice 
photo blow ups of Bart’s hospital. The ledge. The pavement. 
Autopsy reports. Photos of Derren Brown. UFOs. 
In the background, a TV is on with the sound down. News 
strapline:
‘Surface to air missiles in place again. What does Govt
know?’
ANDERSON
Look, if you’re not going to take 
this seriously, Laura -
LAURA
I do take it seriously. I don’t 
think we should wear hats. 
ANDERSON
I formed ‘The Empty Hearse’ so 
that like-minded people could 
meet. Discuss theories... 
Sherlock’s still out there. I’m 
convinced of it.
Suddenly, Laura spots something on the TV. The strapline
has changed:
‘Hat detective returns to life’. 
LAURA (O.S.)
Oh my God! 
Her phone suddenly pings with emails. Around her, the group 
begin to get it. 
Laura holds up her phone, eyes wide in wonder.

With barely a glance down, Sherlock makes his move.
SHERLOCK
What solid information? A secret 
terrorist group is planning an 
attack? Talk about an easy guess. 
That’s what secret terrorist groups 
do - it’s their golf!

An agent gave his life to tell us

None of these ‘markers’ of yours 
has been acting suspiciously?

Your move.

No. But you have to trust me.
He makes his move. 
SHERLOCK
I’ll find the answer. But it’ll be 
in an odd phrase in an on-line 
blog. An unexpected trip to the 
country. A misplaced lonely hearts 
ad. Your move.

Mycroft has a red ‘broken heart’ between tweezers.

Can’t handle a broken heart. How 
very telling.

Don’t be smart.

Oh, that takes me back. “Don’t be 
smart, Sherlock. I’m the smart 
one!”

I am the smart one.
SHERLOCK
I used to think I was an idiot.
MYCROFT
We both thought you were an idiot - 
we had nothing else to go on. Until 
we met other children.
SHERLOCK
Oh, yes. That was a mistake.
MYCROFT
Ghastly. What were they thinking 
of?

Probably something about making 
friends?

I dunno. I thought maybe you’d

Change the subject - now!

Rest assured, Mycroft. Whatever

insignificant. Or bizarre.

He’s secretly pleased to see you, 
underneath all that.
MYCROFT
Sorry, which of us?
MRS HUDSON
Both of you!

SHERLOCK
Hey, tell you what, let’s play 
something else!
MYCROFT
Why are we playing games!!
SHERLOCK
London’s terror alert has been 
raised to critical - I’m just 
trying to pass the time. Let’s do 
deductions!
Sherlock picks up a big, battered, woolly, Trustafarian style 
hat with bobbles on. He tosses it to Mycroft.
SHERLOCK
Client left this - missed them 
while I was out. What do you make 
of it?
MYCROFT
I’m busy. 
SHERLOCK
Come on, it’s been ages.
MYCROFT
I always win.
SHERLOCK
Which is why you can’t resist.
MYCROFT
I find nothing irresistible in the 
hat of a well travelled, 
sentimental, anxious, unfit 
creature of habit with appalling 
halitosis.
(Realises)
Damn.
SHERLOCK
Isolated too, don’t you think?
MYCROFT
Why would he be isolated?
SHERLOCK
He?
MYCROFT
Obviously.
SHERLOCK
Why? Size of the hat?

MYCROFT
Don’t be silly. Some women have 
large heads too. No, he’s recently 
had his hair cut. You can see the 
little hairs adhering to the 
perspiration stains on the inside. 
SHERLOCK
(sulky)
Some women have short hair.
MYCROFT
Balance of probability.  
SHERLOCK
Also you’ve never talked to a woman 
with short hair. Or, you know, a 
woman.
MYCROFT
Stains show he’s out of condition. 
And he’s sentimental because the 
hat has been repaired...
(counts)
...three - four- five times very 
neatly. The cost of the repairs 
must now exceed the cost of the 
hat. So he’s mawkishly attached to 
it. 
SHERLOCK
More than that. One patch, perhaps 
two would indicate sentimentality. 
But five...That’s obsessive 
behaviour. Obsessive compulsive.
MYCROFT
Hardly. Your client left it behind. 
What kind of an obsessive 
compulsive would do that? The 
earlier patches are extensively sun 
bleached so he’s worn it abroad. In 
Peru. 
SHERLOCK
Peru?
MYCROFT
This is a Chullo. The classic 
headwear of the Andean region. It’s 
made from Alpaca.  
SHERLOCK
No.  
MYCROFT
No?

Icelandic sheep wool. Similar but

what you’re looking for. I’ve 
written a blog on the tensile 
strength of certain natural fibres. 
MRS HUDSON
(Wandering past)
I’m sure there’s a crying need for 
that. 
SHERLOCK
You said he was anxious? 
MYCROFT
The ‘bobble’ on the left side has 
been badly chewed, showing he’s a 
man of a nervous disposition -
SHERLOCK
But also a creature of habit as 
he’s never chewed the right hand 
one. 
MYCROFT
Precisely. 
SHERLOCK
And a brief sniff of the offending 
bobble tells us all we need to know 
about the state of his breath. 
Brilliant!
MYCROFT
Elementary. 
SHERLOCK
But you missed his isolation.
MYCROFT
I don’t see it.

It’s plain as day.

MYCROFT
Tell me!
SHERLOCK
Well, obviously someone who’d wear 
a hat as stupid as this isn’t in 
the habit of hanging around other 
people.
MYCROFT
Not at all. Maybe he just doesn’t 
mind being different. He doesn’t 
necessarily have to be isolated.
SHERLOCK
Exactly.
MYCROFT
... I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK
He’s different. So what? Why should 
he mind? You’re quite right.
Mycroft, a little disconcerted. Slightly worried he’s getting 
a life lesson from his brother.
Sherlock pops the hat on his head.
SHERLOCK
Why should anybody mind?
A beat between them. No question - Sherlock is telling him 
something.
Tick tock, goes the clock.
MYCROFT
I’m not lonely, Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
How would you know?
A stare. Then Mycroft stands, having none of this.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Back to work, Sherlock. If you 
don’t mind.

Good morning.
He heads to the stair.

Nothing to worry about.  Take

An old man, MR SZIKORA sits opposite him. He has a woolly 
hat, big bushy, white beard, dark glasses and a thick 
foreign accent.
JOHN
Infection of some sort, by the 
sound of it. Dr Verner’s your 
usual GP, yes?
MR SZIKORA
Yeah. Looked after me man and 
boy. I run a little shop just on 
the corner of Church Street. 
Magazines. DVDs. Got a few little 
beauties here might interest you? 
John looks sidelong at the old man. The dark glasses, the 
beard...
Mr Szikora rummages through his mucky carrier bags. 
MR SZIKORA (CONT’D)
‘Tree Worshippers’, that’s a 
corker. Very saucy. ‘British 
Birds’ - same sort of thing.

No, I’m good, thanks.

‘The Holy War’?  Sounds a bit 
dry, I know but it isn’t. There’s

A damp old cellar. A brick chamber has been revealed by 
excavation and sitting in it, in a cobwebby chair, is a 
skeleton in Victorian clothes! It’s by a desk and clutches 
a nib pen in its hand.
CLOSE on SHERLOCK’s eye through his Zeiss lens. He examines 
the skeleton’s Victorian costume.
Sniffs the fabric. 
On screen text: Pine? Spruce? Cedar. 
The text breaks up into particles and floats upwards like 
pollen and reform as: Mothballs.
Sherlock sniffs the costume again, like a blood-hound. 
On screen text: Carbon particulate. Smoke. Fire damage.
The text dissolves into smoke and drifts away.  
Sherlock smiles to himself.

What? What is it? You’re on to 
something aren’t you?

Maybe.

Suddenly, the room vibrates. 
MOLLY
Trains?
SHERLOCK
Trains. 
He sits back on his haunches and looks at the skeleton in 
its costume. The shoulders of the Victorian frock-coat have 
distinctive dents in them and one side of the fabric is 
faded in a triangular shape. 
In Sherlock’s mind, a white outline appears inside the coat 
- the shape of a tailor’s dummy. The outline spins round
and a shaft of sunlight appears in the room, shining across
one corner of the costume.

Molly and Lestrade exchange a look. 
Sherlock walks through the words, scattering them into 
bits. He busies himself examining the desk. He looks at the 
ink pen and a trail of ink drops that cover the desk.

Doesn’t make sense. 
LESTRADE
What doesn’t?

This skeleton. I’d say it’s no

Six months old.

Sherlock has found a concealed compartment in the desk. He 
puts his hand in and takes out leather-bound book, covered 
in cobwebs. 
He brushes away the cobwebs.
Molly looks.

A large room, almost completely dominated by a massive 
train set. Everywhere there are photos, signs, memorabilia 
devoted to engines: steam, diesel, electric. A model train 
is clattering around its track. 
HOWARD - a large unhealthy-looking man, shows SHERLOCK and 
MOLLY inside. He’s holding the woolly hat. 
HOWARD
Thanks for hanging onto it. 
SHERLOCK
Not a problem.

Girlfriend?

Line. One of my jobs is to wipe 
the security footage once it’s 
been cleared. I was just whizzing 
through and I found something a 
bit...bizarre.
He takes out an iPad-like tablet and jabs at it. Fuzzy CCTV 
footage appears.

SHERLOCK
What? He said. He likes trains.
On screen: A tube train trundles into Westminster Station.
The train doors open. A tall, SUAVE MAN gets into the last 
carriage. He’s the only passenger. Howard fiddles with the 
screen and the image zips forward. 
HOWARD
Next stop St James’ Park Station 
five minutes later. And...
The train arrives at St James’ Park Station - and there’s 
nobody on it!
Sherlock sits forward.

The doors open. 
HOWARD
And the car is empty at St James’ 
Park! Explain that, Mr Holmes!
MOLLY
Couldn’t he have jumped off?

There’s a safety mechanism to 
prevent the doors opening in 
transit. But there’s something 
else...

MOLLY

Hm?
Sherlock turns to Howard.
SHERLOCK
So if the driver was in on it, 
his passenger did get off. But 
why? 
HOWARD

It’s not that simple, Mr Holmes. 
There’s nowhere he could go! It’s 
a straight run on the District 
Line between the two stations. No 
side-tunnels. No maintenance 
tunnels. There’s nothing on any 
map. Nothing.

Train never stops and a man 
vanishes. Good, innit?
He jabs at the controls again. The CC-TV footage zips back

MARY
Someone sent me this. I thought 
it was just some Bible thing. 
Spam. But it’s not. It’s a skip 
code.
On Sherlock: just the briefest beat of surprise. 
He looks at the phone. 
SHERLOCK
(nods)
Every third word. Starting with 
the first. 
Text on screen: 
“Save souls now!! - John, 3:16 - ‘Whatson in London’. 
The ‘h’ drops away and the words scrunch up to form:
Save John Watson.  
The phone beeps again. 
A new message: “You’re the tops! Very good show. Warm, my 
friends. Go ahead now. Euston or bust. Now is the time”. 
MARY
You’re...very...warm. 
Go...Euston...
SHERLOCK

Darkness. Breathing. Deep breathing. Suddenly -
A sliver of light. We briefly see JOHN, unconscious, tape 
around his mouth. He’s surrounded by branches, as if he’s 
been placed in a thicket or a giant nest. He’s curled up. 
Embryonic. 
Voices. Coming closer. Excited voices. Children’s voices. 
Weird lights. Flames in the distance. 
John’s eyes flicker. Consciousness struggling to come back. 
But he’s drugged. Can’t seem to move. 
Voices. Distorted.

Suddenly John understands. His eyes widen in fear. 
We pull back from them. Back, back, back, revealing that

Around it, a ring of cars. Excited CHILDREN and their

The motorbike screeches down Euston Road. SHERLOCK is

Mary’s phone beeps. 
The phone beeps again. Mary studies it.
On-screen: Saint or sinner? James or John? The More is less. 
Consider the fields.

From within the bonfire, John’s desperate, primal cries. 
Without a second thought, Sherlock pulls off his coat, 
covers his head with it and starts scrabbling at the

A client.
SHERLOCK is at his wall, not listening. There are masses of 
Tube maps covering every inch of the floor. 
Six photos form a pyramid shape. Five have been crossed out 
- now including the BURLY MAN. Only one remains, at the
top. An imposing, SUAVE MAN in robes and ermine. Next to
him is pinned a blurry photo blow up of the man from the
CCTV. They’re one and the same.
ELDERLY LADY
...because he’s always losing 
things down there aren’t you,

She turns. Sitting behind her is an ELDERLY MAN.

SHERLOCK
So. Did you find it eventually? 
Your...

ELDERLY LADY
Well, yes, thank goodness. So we 
got the coach in time after all. 
We managed to see the Tower and 
St Paul’s but they’re not letting 
anyone into Parliament because 
there’s some big debate going 
on...
The door opens. JOHN is standing there. He looks washed out 
but ok. SHERLOCK immediately perks up.
SHERLOCK
John.
JOHN
Oh. You’re busy. Sorry -
SHERLOCK
No, no, no, no! They were just

ELDERLY LADY
Oh. Were we?

Why would an agent give his life

insubstantial? That’s what’s

Moran didn’t disappear, the whole

must’ve diverted the train 
somehow. Then detached the last 
carriage.
JOHN
Detached it where? You said there 
was nothing between those 
stations. 
SHERLOCK
Nothing on the maps. But 
eliminate all other factors and 
whatever’s left must be the 
truth. That tube carriage 
vanished. So it must be 
somewhere. 
JOHN
Why, though? Why detach the 
carriage in the first place? 
Sherlock thinks. 
SHERLOCK
It vanishes between Westminster 
and St James’ Park. Lord Moran 
vanishes. You’re kidnapped and 
nearly burnt to death at a 
fireworks display. What’s the 
date, John? Today’s date? 
JOHN
November the...Oh my God.
SHERLOCK
Moran’s a peer of the realm. He’d

Sherlock!
Sherlock turns.
SHERLOCK
What?
JOHN
It’s - isn’t it? Live?
SHERLOCK
Perfectly safe if we avoid the

Great. Yes. Avoid the rails. In

The tunnel curves. From far away comes a deep, rumbling 
roar. SHERLOCK and JOHN stop. Listen. It’s the sound of a 
distant tube train. 
They tramp on and on. Suddenly - 
JOHN
There! Look! 
John’s pointing. Sherlock brings the torch to bear on --
A single train carriage. 
It’s marooned on the rails ahead of them.
Ghostly.
Slowly, he points his torch above the train.
The vast ‘chimney’ extends upwards. It’s covered in white 
packages. 
John and Sherlock exchange a look.
JOHN
Demolition charges.
Gingerly, they step up onto the back of the train.

It’s a regular modern Tube car. All seems perfectly normal. 
No TNT. Nothing.
JOHN
It’s empty. There’s nothing.
Sherlock’s keen gaze is all over the compartment.
SHERLOCK
Isn’t there?
A corner of the upholstery is loose. Sherlock worries at it 
and then rips the fabric. Underneath, it’s glittering with 
cables, lights, instrumentation. 
Sherlock continues, dragging away the advertising signs and 
seats. He suddenly pulls up sharp.
SHERLOCK
This is the bomb.

Doesn’t mean I know how to defuse

I wasn’t in bomb disposal! I’m a

SHERLOCK
And a soldier! As you keep 
reminding us all!
JOHN
Can’t we...rip off the timer or

SHERLOCK
That would set it off.

Why do you never call the police!

SHERLOCK
How will that help?
JOHN
You’ve salted away every bloody

Yes!!

SHERLOCK
Mycroft fed Moriarty information 
about me. In turn, Moriarty gave 
him hints - just hints - as to 
the extent of his web. We let him 
go because we needed him to 
believe he had the upper hand. 
Then I sat back and let him 
destroy my reputation, bit by 
bit.

SHERLOCK is bouncing a squash ball against the units of the

SHERLOCK (V.O.)
I had to make him believe he’d 
beaten me. Utterly defeated me. 
And then he’d show his hand. 
There were thirteen likely 
scenarios once we were up on that 
roof. Each of them were 
rigorously worked out and given a 
code name. It wasn’t just my 
reputation that Moriarty needed 
to bury. I had to die.

Like I’ve always said. And I was 
telling John the truth. Even 
then. 
JOHN looks up in horror at SHERLOCK on the roof. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)

SHERLOCK
Goodbye, John.
From SHERLOCK’s perspective, we can see JOHN behind the 
ambulance station.
MOLLY appears in a lower window of Bart’s.
On the side of the ambulance station facing Sherlock stand 
ten BURLY MEN. Propped against the wall, a massive airbag.

coats) out of the window.
Slam! It hits the pavement.
CUT TO:
The corpse on the pavement. We pull back to see what’s on 
the other side of it:
SHERLOCK sliding casually to the pavement from the airbag.
He dashes across the road and flattens himself against the 
wall of the ambulance station. The burly men throw the 
airbag into the back of the laundry truck and it drives 
away. They melt away into the crowd.
CUT TO:
JOHN races round the corner and sees what he thinks is 
SHERLOCK’s body lying on the pavement.
Close on the earpiece of the CYCLIST. He pedals furiously 
towards John and deliberately collides with him. John goes 
down. 
CUT TO:
SHERLOCK stands by the wall of the ambulance station as ON-
LOOKERS cover him in blood. Fake DOCTORS pick up the corpse 
and push it into the phone box. Sherlock, drenched in 
blood, takes its place, lying down on the pavement. The 
last thing he does as he lowers himself onto the flagstones 
is to take out the black squash ball and place it under his 
arm.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
Squash ball in the armpit. Apply 
enough pressure and the pulse is 
temporarily cut off.
CUT TO:
John gets woozily to his feet. Sees Sherlock’s broken body 
lying on the pavement, surrounded by passers-by and medical 
staff.

coat.

ANDERSON
Hang on. Hang on. That doesn’t

sure John would stand on that 
exact spot? What if he’d moved. 
And how did you do all that so

hit him? And anyway, why would 
you tell me all this? If you’d 
pulled that off, I’m the last

No but seriously. Because when you 
were dead, I went to your grave...
SHERLOCK
I should hope so.
JOHN
But I made a little speech, I 
actually spoke to you...
SHERLOCK
I know. I was there.
John, staring at him, a little haunted.
JOHN
I asked you for one more miracle. I 
asked you to stop being dead.
Sherlock holds his look for a moment.
SHERLOCK
I heard you.
On John - half bemused, half moved.
SHERLOCK
Anyway! Time to go and be Sherlock 
Holmes.
And, as they go to step outside, Sherlock hesitates. 
Twinkles at John - and lifts something from a coat peg. 
It’s a deerstalker! 
CUT TO:
EXT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY.

SHERLOCK and JOHN emerge into the throng of REPORTERS. 
Over this: Crump! Bang! Whiz!
Fireworks! In the black November sky over Baker Street, 
they burst and blossom as if in celebration. The boys are 
back!

We pull back through the massive crowd. On the other side 
of the street stands a MAN.
We only see him from behind, looking on as the press go 
crazy over Sherlock and John. 
He takes off his GOLD RIMMED SPECTACLES, breathes on the 
lenses and wipes them clean with a beautifully laundered 
white handkerchief.
