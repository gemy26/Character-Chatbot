DARKNESS.

Fade up on a patch of deep, pellucid blue. 
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
“There was once a merchant in the 
famous market at Baghdad. One day, 
he saw a stranger looking at him in 
surprise. And he knew that the 
stranger was Death...
The blue colour shifts a little. It’s a tank of water.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
Pale and trembling, the merchant 
fled the market place, and made his 
way many, many miles to the city of 
Samarra. For there, he was sure, 
Death could not find him. But when 
at last he came to Samarra, the 
merchant saw, waiting for him, the 
grim figure of Death...
A monstrous gliding shadow in the rippling blue. 
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
‘Very well’, said the merchant. ‘I 
give in. I am yours. But tell me, 
why did you look surprised when you 
saw me this morning in Baghdad?’ 
Now a giant shape hoving through. A shark ...
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
‘Because’, said Death, ‘I had an 
appointment with you tonight. 
Now close on the terrible blank eye staring out at us, as it 
drifts past...
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
In Samarra...’”
Letting the shark go now. The rippling changes quality, like 
sunlight dazzling on water.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
When does the path we walk on lock 
around our feet? When does the road 
become a river, with only one 
destination?
And in a moment of brightness, the water becomes a river, 
sunshine glittering madly. De-focussed in the foreground, 
three kids playing, barely glimpsed.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
Death waits for us all in Samarra. 
But can Samarra be avoided?

INT. GEORGIAN EMBASSY - DAY.

- shafts of wintry sunlight in the luxurious interior of a 
foreign embassy. 
Caption: Tbilisi, Georgia. Six years ago. 
Amongst the gilt and chandeliers, a group of weary, desperate 
HOSTAGES, huddled up in coats and blankets.
Guarding them with guns, bored-looking TERRORISTS.
Two of the hostages are playing chess. The AMBASSADOR and her 
HUSBAND.
AMBASSADOR
(to terrorist)
What do you think? Mate in two?
The terrorist looks away. 
HUSBAND
Don’t antagonise them, darling. 
AMBASSADOR
What else is there to do? Chess 
palls after three months. 
Everything palls. I mean, getting 
shot isn’t an enticing prospect but 
it’s the waiting that kills you.
HUSBAND
Don’t talk like that. They’ll send 
someone soon. 
AMBASSADOR
‘They’? Who are ‘they’? Seems to 
me, we put an awful lot of faith in 
‘they’. I’ve got something ‘they’ 
would dearly love, if only we could 
get out of here. 
(grim smile)
I’ve got ammo...
HUSBAND
Ammo?
SMASH!!!
Through the windows in the high ceiling, abseil TWO MASKED 
FIGURES! 
They shoot down the nearest Terrorists. The door bursts open 
and TWO MORE MASKED FIGURES burst inside. 
On screen graphic: Over each of the Figures appears a letter.

Expertly, they shoot down the remaining guards. It’s like a 
ballet of violent death. 
The letters hover over them as they do their grim work. 
The Ambassador and her husband look on in shock and awe as 
each of their captors is despatched. 
The masked figures now stand in a different configuration.
On-screen graphic: the letters re-assemble themselves into...
A...G...R...A...
‘R’, a woman, steps forward. 
‘R’
Madam Ambassador? 
AMBASSADOR
(smiles)
What took you so long?
‘R’
Can’t get the staff.
With expert efficiency, the liberators usher the hostages out 
of the room. 
CUT TO:
INT. GEORGIAN EMBASSY. GREAT HALL - DAY.

The MASKED FIGURES and the HOSTAGES stream out into a huge, 
marble-columned hall. 
Suddenly, from all around them - the cocking of guns. 
They’re completely surrounded by TERRORISTS. One is a huge 
man with distinctive GOLD TEETH. He smiles horribly.
The four rescuers pull off their masks. They are GABRIEL, 
ALEX and AJAY - a slim, handsome Indian man in his 30s with a 
chain round his neck. 
AJAY
What now? What do we do?
The last rescuer, ‘R’, removes her mask. Dark haired. 
Younger. But it’s the woman who will become -- MARY WATSON! 
She looks round at the impossible situation. 
MARY
We die.
She cocks her gun.

A charming country house in extensive grounds. There are lots 
of cars parked on the sweeping gravel driveway. 
The lights in the house are ablaze.
Over this: a chorus of ‘Happy Birthday David’.

Party poppers burst into the air. 
The comfortable library, full of people. There’s a big banner 
that reads ‘Happy 50th!’
DAVID WELSBOROUGH (50) is kissing his wife EMMA (40s). 
There’s a huge cheer and a chorus of ‘Happy Birthday’. 
EMMA
Happy birthday, love. 
DAVID
Thanks. God. Fifty. Where does it 
go? I know for a fact I was only 
twenty one this time last week. 
EMMA
Impossible. That was before you 
knew me. 
DAVID
“And there never - 
EMMA
(a familiar chorus)
- there never was such a time.”
They laugh and kiss again. 
Close by, there’s a kind of shrine to Margaret Thatcher. 
There are photos, paintings, busts of the late PM. 
EMMA (CONT’D)
She’s looking at me disapprovingly 
again. 
DAVID 
She’s just jealous.

His phone starts to buzz. 
EMMA (CONT’D)
David. You promised...
DAVID
Think it’s just a message. No, it’s 
a Skype call.
He pronounces Skype the way you might handle a rotting, week- 
old fish.
EMMA
Must be Charlie then.
She glances at framed photos on the table. There are lots of 
a young man in his 20s - CHARLIE. 
EMMA (CONT’D)
Well at least he’s phoning, I 
suppose.
David clicks his phone.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Hello?
A very pixilated image of Charlie - he’s in the Selfie pose, 
with a mountain range visible behind him.
CHARLIE
(On screen)
Hey Dad! Happy birthday! Sorry to 
miss the party, but travel broadens 
the mind, right?
DAVID
Wish you’d tell the PM - he seems 
determined to keep me at home.
(Shakes the phone)
Picture’s frozen. 
CHARLIE
(V.O.)
Yeah, signal’s rubbish - but I can 
still hear you.
DAVID
Why’s it rubbish, where are you?
EMMA
How is he? Is he eating? Ask him if 
he’s eating!
David tries to shush her.

DAVID ducks outside onto the large driveway of the house, 
phone at his ear now so he can hear better.
DAVID
So where are you?
(Silence)
Charlie? Are you there?
CHARLIE
(V.O.)
Sorry, I’m here, I’m just a bit - 
...
DAVID
You okay?
CHARLIE
(V.O.)
It’s nothing, probably just the 
altitude.
DAVID
Altitude??
CHARLIE
(V.O.)
I’m in Tibet, didn’t you see the 
mountains?
DAVID
Never mind mountains, your Mum 
wants to know if you’re eating. 
CHARLIE
(V.O.)
No, not eating at all, but don’t 
worry, I’m drinking twice as much.
DAVID
(Smiling)
I’ll tell her that.
CHARLIE
(V.O.)
Wait till I’m home, I want to 
watch. Listen, Dad. Could you do me 
a favour?

CHARLIE (V.O.)
A favour. Could you just check 
something on my car?
DAVID
Your car?
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Yeah. Humour me! It’s to settle a 
bet. The guys here don’t believe 
I’ve got a Power Ranger stuck to 
the bonnet! 
DAVID
Oh that toy.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Yeah! Could you take a photo and 
send it? 
DAVID
(laughs)
Yeah. ‘Course. Give me sec.
David walks past a number of cars on the drive and then stops 
at a slightly beaten up, studenty-looking one which is 
furthest from the house. He activates the torch on his phone 
and passes it over the car. Stuck to the bonnet, like a Rolls-
Royce emblem is a Power Ranger toy. 
In the light of David’s phone torch we see inside the car. 
Driver’s seat. Passenger seat. It’s empty and undisturbed. 
David lines up the phone, takes a picture of the toy and 
sends it as a text.
DAVID (CONT’D)
All done! You got it? I remember 
when you got that. You were 
obsessed with those ruddy things! 
So, when are you coming home?
Silence from the phone. 
DAVID (CONT’D)
Charlie? When should we expect you 
back? 
Silence. 
DAVID (CONT’D)
(sighs)
Bloody Skype. 
He tries again.
DAVID (CONT’D)
Charlie?
Nothing.

That was the night of the party. 
Then, a week later...

Iconic shot. SHERLOCK with his fingers steepled under his 
chin, eyes closed. Next to him - JOHN.
JOHN
Yes? 
They sit opposite D.I. LESTRADE.
LESTRADE

Sherlock smiles.

Charlie’s car is parked where it was. Alone now.
Suddenly, another car comes careering down the drive, weaving 
about erratically.  
LESTRADE (V.O.)
Drunk driver. Totally smashed. Cops 
were chasing him and he pulled onto 
the drive of the Welsborough house 
to try and get away. Unfortunately -
The drunk’s car screeches over the gravel and slams into the 
side of Charlie’s car. 
BOOOOM!
Both cars explode. 
Close on the Power Ranger toy melting over the blazing 
bonnet...
LESTRADE (V.O.)
The drunk guy survived. They 
managed to pull him out. But when 
they put the fire out and examined 
the other car -

JOHN
Who’s body?
LESTRADE
Charlie Welsborough. The son. 
JOHN
What??
LESTRADE
The son who was in Tibet. DNA all 
checks out. Night of the party the 
car was empty. A week later, the 
dead boy is found at the wheel.
SHERLOCK, eyes still closed, laughs.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
Thought it’d tickle you. 
JOHN
Is there a lab report?
LESTRADE hands him a file. 
LESTRADE
Charlie Welsborough’s the son of a 
Cabinet Minister. I’m under a lot 
of pressure to get results.
Sherlock’s eyes snap open. 
SHERLOCK
Who cares about that? Tell me about 
the seats!
He looks over at John.
JOHN
The seats?
SHERLOCK
Yes! The car seats. 
He grabs the file and scans it with almost supernatural 
speed.

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Made of vinyl. But two different 
types of vinyl present. 
(to Lestrade)
Was it his own car?  
LESTRADE
Yes. Not very flash. He was a 
student. 
SHERLOCK
That’s suggestive.
LESTRADE
Why?
SHERLOCK
Because vinyl is cheaper than 
leather. 
LESTRADE
(baffled)
Right. 
JOHN
(grabbing report)
There’s something else.
SHERLOCK
Yes?
JOHN
According to this, Charlie 
Welsborough had already been dead a 
week. 
SHERLOCK
What?
JOHN
The body in the car. Dead a week. 
SHERLOCK
Oh, this is a good one! Is it my 
birthday? 
(to Lestrade)
You want help? 
LESTRADE
Yes, please. 
SHERLOCK
On one condition. 
LESTRADE
Ok. 
SHERLOCK
Take all the credit. It gets boring 
if I just solve them all.

LESTRADE
You say that, but then John blogs 
about it and you get the credit 
anyway! 
JOHN
Yeah. He’s got a point.
LESTRADE
Which makes me look like some prima 
donna who insists on getting credit 
for something he didn’t do!
JOHN
Think you’ve hit a sore spot, 
Sherlock.
LESTRADE
Like I’m some sort of credit 
junkie. 
JOHN
Definitely a sore spot. 
LESTRADE
So you take the glory, thanks all 
the same. 
SHERLOCK
Ok.
LESTRADE
Just solve the bloody thing, will 
you. It’s driving me nuts. 
SHERLOCK
Anything you say, Giles. 
Lestrade glares at him. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Just kidding. 
Lestrade looks down at the report. In that second, Sherlock 
looks appealingly to John. 
John mouths ‘Greg!’
Sherlock mouths ‘What?’
John mouths ‘Greg!’ Just as Lestrade looks up and nearly 
catches him. 
John clears his throat, tries to cover. 
JOHN
Obvious what happened, though, 
isn’t it?
Sherlock turns, surprised.

John, you amaze me. You know what

JOHN
Not a clue. It’s just you usually 
say that around this point. 
Sherlock smiles and pulls on his coat. He turns confidently 
to Lestrade.
SHERLOCK
Come on then. Let’s solve your 
little problem. Greg.
Lestrade looks childishly pleased.
LESTRADE

Did you hear that?
JOHN
(innocently)
I know!

LESTRADE

How’s it going then? Fatherhood?
JOHN
Great! Good, yeah. Amazing. 
LESTRADE
Getting any sleep?
JOHN
Christ, no. 
LESTRADE
At the beck and call of a 
screaming, demanding baby. Woken up 
at all hours to obey its every 
whim. 
(Shoots a look at 
Sherlock)
Must feel very different. 
SHERLOCK.

JOHN
(Getting the joke)
You know how it is. All you do is 
clear up the mess and pat them on 
the head.
SHERLOCK.
Are you two having a joke?
JOHN
Not a word of thanks. Can’t even 
tell people’s faces apart.
SHERLOCK.
This is a joke, isn’t it?
LESTRADE
Yeah, and it’s all “ohh, aren’t you 
clever. Oh, you’re so, so clever!”
SHERLOCK
Is it about me?
LESTRADE
I think he needs winding.
JOHN
You know, that really could be it.
SHERLOCK.
No. Don’t get it.

SHERLOCK, LESTRADE and JOHN are in a cab.

Suddenly, Sherlock opens the door of the moving cab --

-- and steps into the back of another car as it bombs along a 
motorway! 
This is a physical flashback. 
The plan is for this to be come the signature style of all 
three episodes. A more theatrical type of visual flourish.

We’re talking about sets built adjacent to one another so 
that our heroes literally walk through walls, doors, or in 
this case...
...the back of John and Mary’s car. 
Three months earlier. 
Sherlock is texting.
A howl of pain! 
Whip-pan right to reveal, sitting next to him in the back of 
this new car - MARY! In the last stages of labour. 
JOHN
Sherlock, will you put that bloody 
thing away! 
Driving the car at top speed - JOHN! 
SHERLOCK
Yes, of course. Absolutely.
JOHN
This is hardly the time! 
MARY
Ohmygod! Ohmygod!! 
On Sherlock’s phone, two faces on Skype. 
DIMMOCK
Mr Holmes?
HOPKINS
Mr Holmes?
SHERLOCK
Give me a minute. Spinning a lot of 
plates here. 
JOHN
Sherlock! 
SHERLOCK
Yes. Right. Fine. Absolutely. 
(into phone)
Hopkins, arrest Wilson. Dimmock - 
Look in the lymph nodes. 
The Skypees react. They’re D.I. DIMMOCK from ‘The Blind 
Banker’ and a newcomer, D.I. STELLA HOPKINS (40s, smart)

SHERLOCK
Yes. You may have nothing but a 
limbless torso but there’ll still 
be traces of ink in the lymph nodes 
under the armpits. If your mystery 
corpse had tattoos, the signs will 
be there. 
DIMMOCK
Bloody hell. Is that a guess?
SHERLOCK
I never guess! 
Beat.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
But it’s not too early to 
speculate. I think it could be... 
you know...him. 
DIMMOCK
(awed)
Moriarty? 
Sherlock nods.
DIMMOCK (CONT’D)
You really think so? 
SHERLOCK
(laughs)
‘Course not! This is child’s play. 
Mary reaches out her hand and grips Sherlock’s -- 
-- knocking the phone to the car floor. 
JOHN
(over his shoulder)
Ok, Mary. Calm. Calm breaths. Like 
in the classes, remember? 
MARY
‘Course I remember!
JOHN
Think of the word ‘relax’. 
MARY
What??
JOHN
It has two syllables, ‘re’ and 
‘lax’.

So he’s the killer? The canary

Sherlock bends down and pretends to fumble retrieving his 
phone from the well of the car seat. He uses the chance to 
whisper into the phone. 
SHERLOCK
Of course he’s the killer!
HOPKINS
Didn’t see that coming.

JOHN
Nearly there!
MARY
John! JOHN!! PULL OVER!!
JOHN
We’re nearly -

The car’s in a layby. Inside - an exhausted but beaming MARY. 
Next to her, JOHN holding a beautiful, perfect baby girl.

Nice one, doctor. 
JOHN
Takes two. 
Sherlock approaches from outside the car, holding his phone.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Sherlock, I told you! Put that

Moriarty behind any of these cases -

MRS HUDSON has just taken a photo. 
It’s some days later. 
The room is full of presents, cards and people.
MARY is cradling the baby. JOHN, beaming, next to her. 
SHERLOCK is in the corner, inevitably texting. MOLLY is there 
too. 
MRS HUDSON
Has that come out? They never come 
out when I take them. 
MOLLY
Let’s have a look. 
She takes the camera. 
MRS HUDSON
She’s beautiful. How’re you 
feeling?
MARY
Tired.
JOHN
Tired.

Well, you know what I think.
JOHN
It’s not a girl’s name.
MARY
It’s not a girl’s name. 
Beat.
JOHN
And we don’t want anything too 
trendy. 
MOLLY
I know! Used to be just pop stars 
and footballers. Now it’s people 
you thought were sane. They call 
their kids all sorts of bollocks 
these days. 
MARY
We’re definitely not calling her 
that. 
John smiles and kisses her. She nudges him.

Oh yeah.

Sherlock doesn’t look up from his phone. 
SHERLOCK
Me too, what?
JOHN
Godfather. We’d like you to be 
Godfather. 
SHERLOCK
God is a ludicrous fiction dreamt 
up by inadequates who abnegate all 
responsibility to an invisible 
magic friend.  
JOHN
Yeah - but there’ll be cake. Will 
you do it? 
SHERLOCK
I’ll get back to you.
John turns to Mary. Shrugs. 
He looks over at Sherlock who continues texting furiously.

“Fresh paint to disguise another smell.”
“Odd socks? Arrest brother-in-law.”

John looks on, concerned. Then he walks out of the ‘scene’ 
and onto --
CUT TO:

-- a bus. 
We’re now in John’s ‘physical flashback’. 
The bus is fairly full. A lot of tired-looking commuters, 
some sound asleep. Their faces balloon in the distortion of 
the windows. 
JOHN’s amongst them, grey with fatigue. He yawns hugely and 
is staring into space when he suddenly notices a BEAUTIFUL 
WOMAN woman across the way. 
She smiles warmly. 
John perks up. Smiles back. Then he looks away, a little 
shyly. 
He contemplates his shoes for a minute, then risks another 
look. 
The Beautiful Woman is still looking. She smiles again, just 
a little. The side of her soft lips tugging upwards. And 
there’s a real twinkle in her eye. 
John can’t help but respond. 
He’s pleased. Despite a crushing lack of sleep, despite 
feeling like death, he’s clearly still got it. 
The bus pulls up at the next stop and John makes to go. 
He risks one last look back. 
The Beautiful Woman is beaming at him with a very amused 
expression. 
John practically smooths his hair back like Roger Moore, he’s 
so delighted. He nods to the woman and then gets off, a 
little reluctantly.

JOHN watches as the bus pulls away, still smiling to himself. 
Suddenly, he catches sight of his reflection in the glass of

He sees himself properly for the first time. 
Tucked into his hair is a large plastic daisy.

JOHN and SHERLOCK are at the back of a little group making 
their way down the aisle towards the font. 
MARY, MRS HUDSON, LESTRADE and MOLLY lead. 
Sherlock is still texting. He doesn’t look up as he walks 
along, phone glued to his hand.  
JOHN

You could come round and see the

Christ's name. What name have you 
given your daughter? 
MARY
Rosamund Mary. 
SHERLOCK
(sotto to Molly)
Rosamund?
MOLLY
It means ‘Rose of the world’. Rosie 
for short. Didn’t you get John’s 
text?
SHERLOCK
I delete his texts. I delete any 
text that starts with ‘Hi’. I’d 
rather cut to the chase. 
MOLLY
I can’t think why people think 
you’re an unemotional bastard.
Mrs Hudson clears her throat. Molly mouths ‘sorry’. She nods 
urgently to Sherlock - ‘phone!’
He holds it behind his back but we see he continues texting.
VICAR 
Now for the godparents.
He beams at Mrs Hudson, Molly and Sherlock.
VICAR (CONT’D)
Are you ready to help the parents 
of this child in their duty as

crying. 
Sherlock lets his smile drop.

Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am 
most terribly sorry about your 
daughter - 
JOHN

Son. 
SHERLOCK
Son. 
LESTRADE
Mr and Mrs Welsborough. This is Mr 
Sherlock Holmes. 
DAVID
Thank you for coming. We’ve heard a 
great deal about you. If anyone can 
throw light into this darkness, 
surely it will be you.
SHERLOCK
Well I think it’s possible that I 
can -
And he breaks off.
And it’s like something has impacted inside his brain. New 
thought, tolling like a bell in his mind.
All around him the room, seems to slow, to blur, recede -
- and now he’s slowly turning his head, to look at -
The Thatcher shrine. Amongst the memorabilia, there is a 
distinctive gap, where something should stand.
On Sherlock, staring at that -
- playing across his face, just a hint of the rippling blue 
light from the beginning - a portent of terrible things to 
come....
Voices talking to him - they sound distant, underwater.

get over this.

No. Shouldn’t think so. 
Sherlock has turned to look a the shrine again, as if drawn 
magnetically.
JOHN flashes him a look, irritated at his callousness - 
- but now caught by Sherlock’s mood change. What’s happened? 
SHERLOCK
I’m very sorry, excuse me a moment.
He strides over to the shrine, now a little way from the 
others. John flashes an apologetic smile at the others.

Flashback. 
CHARLIE’s car is parked on the driveway.
And Charlie himself is behind the wheel! 
From the house, a muffled chorus of ‘Happy Birthday’.
Charlie takes out his phone jabs, away at it.
On screen text: SENDING FILE.

From inside the car CHARLIE watches as his father leaves the 
house. 
CHARLIE
Could you just check something on 
my car?
DAVID
Your car?
CHARLIE
Yeah. Humour me! It’s to settle a 
bet. The guys here don’t believe 
I’ve got a Power Ranger stuck to 
the bonnet! 
DAVID
Oh that toy.
CHARLIE
Yeah! Could you take a photo and 
send it? 
DAVID
(laughs)
Yeah. ‘Course. Give me sec.
Quick as a flash, CHARLIE grabs the passenger seat.

Two different types of vinyl 
present in the burnt-out remains. 
One, the actual passenger seat. The 
other, a good copy. Or good enough, 
anyway. 
Charlie removes a fake, hollow passenger seat that’s covering 
the actual passenger seat. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Effectively, a costume.
Charlie gets ‘into’ the fake seat which covers him. It now 
looks like there’s no-one at the wheel of the car. 
DAVID shines his phone torch over the car. It appears to be 
empty.

That’s when it happened. I can’t be

Charlie must have had some sort of

MYCROFT
Sorry. I’ve never been very good

SHERLOCK
Listen - Moriarty. Did he have any 
connection with Thatcher, any 
interest in her?
MYCROFT
Why on earth would he?
SHERLOCK
(Flaring)
I don’t know, you tell me!
MYCROFT
(Glancing at a file)
In the last year of his life, 
Moriarty was involved in four 
political assassinations, over 
seventy assorted robberies and 
terrorist attacks, a chemical 
weapons factory in North Korea, and 
latterly showed some interest in 
tracking down the black pearl of 
the Borgias - which is still 
missing, by the way, in case you 
feel like applying yourself to 
something practical.
SHERLOCK
It’s just a pearl, get another one. 
There’s something important about 
this, I know there is. 
On Sherlock’s face: the watery rippling. A flash of the dead-
eyed shark.
SHERLOCK
Maybe it’s Moriarty, maybe it’s 
not. But something’s coming.

you could attenuate to every 
quivering strand of data, the 
future would be entirely 
calculable. As inevitable as 
mathematics.
MYCROFT
Appointment In Samarra. 
SHERLOCK
I’m sorry? 
MYCROFT
The Merchant who can’t outrun 
Death. You hated that story, when 
you were little - less keen on pre-
destination back then. 
SHERLOCK
I’m not keen on it now.
MYCROFT
You wrote your own version, 
remember? Appointment In Sumatra. 
The merchant goes to a different 
city and he’s perfectly fine.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, starts heading for the door.

you can give up. You don’t want to 
buy the pipe because that means 
you’re not serious about trying to 
quit. So instead you buy individual 
ones. Always sure that each one 
will be your last. Anything to add,

SHERLOCK
Did you ever think your wife was a

Well...

You think she may be having an 
affair. I’m afraid it’s more 
serious than that. Your wife is a 
spy. 
RAY
What? 
SHERLOCK
You were right. Her real name is 
Greta Bengsdotter. Swedish by 
birth, and perhaps the most 
dangerous spy in the world. She’s 
been operating in deep cover as 
your wife for the past four years 
for one reason only. As a means of 
getting close to the American 
Embassy which is across the road

Tomorrow morning, the US President

greets the staff, Greta 
Bengsdotter, disguised as a twenty-
two stone cleaner, will inject him 
in the back of the neck with a 
dangerous new drug hidden in a 
secret compartment inside her 
padded armpit. This drug will 
render the President entirely 
susceptible to the will of his new 
master - none other than James 
Moriarty. 
RAY
What? 
SHERLOCK
Moriarty will then use the 
President as a pawn to destabilise 
the United Nations General Assembly 
which is about to vote on a treaty 
of nuclear non-proliferation, 
tipping the balance in favour of a 
first strike policy against Russia. 
The chain of events will then prove 
unstoppable, thus precipitating 
World War Three.

Are you serious?

Of course not! His wife left him 
because his breath stinks and likes 
to wear her lingerie.

I don’t!

Identical busts?
LESTRADE
Yeah. And this one to a Dr Barnicot 
in Holborn. Three in total. God 
knows who’d do something like this. 
He glances at his watch. 
JOHN
(looking at Sherlock)
Well, some people have a complex 
like that. An idee fixe. They 
become obsessed with one thing and 
can’t let it go. 
SHERLOCK
No..No good. There were other 
images of Margaret...Margaret...
JOHN
You know who she is.
SHERLOCK
...Thatcher...around the first 
break in. Why would a monomaniac 
pick just one? Ah!
JOHN
What?
Sherlock holds up a piece of plaster between forceps. 
SHERLOCK
Blood. Quite a bit of it too. No-
one injured at the scene of the 
crime? 
LESTRADE
No.
He looks at his watch again.
SHERLOCK
Then the killer cut himself 
breaking the bust. Come on!
He drops the fragment into a little plastic bag and speeds 
towards the door. He takes out his phone and starts texting.

No. He’s got a lunch date with a

SHERLOCK
The right sleeve of your jacket.
Lestrade looks down. Sherlock pulls a long, dark hair from 
Lestrade’s sleeve.

A den-like space, packed with computers. Fans whir to keep

At the main console, a pale, geeky YOUNG MAN, tapping away at 
his keyboard with almost supernatural speed. 
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
There’s a kid I know. Brilliant 
hacker. One of the world’s best. 
Got himself into serious trouble 
with the Americans a couple of

The Intruder turns round. A slim, hooded man in black, one 
hand heavily bandaged. He pulls out a gun but Sherlock lashes 
out with his foot and the gun goes clattering across the

Suddenly, incongruous muzak begins to play.
Pan pipes. Whale song! 
Each trill and plaintive note accompanies a smash in the guts 
as Sherlock and the Intruder battle it out in a seething ball 
of fists and violence! Sherlock manages to remove the 
Intruder’s mask. 
A handsome Indian man is revealed. He has a vivid scar down 
one side of his face. 
We recognise him as AJAY from the pre-titles Embassy siege. 
SHERLOCK
You were on the run. Nowhere to 
hide your precious cargo. 
Ajay lashes out. Sherlock dodges. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
And you find yourself in a workshop

They grapple fiercely. Gradually, Ajay forces Sherlock’s head 
down so it’s only an inch above the water. He glances to his 
side where there sensor is set in the tiles. 
Ajay slashes his hand in front of the sensor. 
At once, water begins to bubble up, splashing into Sherlock’s 
face, like water-boarding. 
Sherlock gasps and chokes as the jacuzzi erupts in his face, 
overwhelming his mouth and nose. 
Ajay’s iron grip tightens and Sherlock’s head goes under the 
water. 
Sherlock struggles desperately - but he’s losing. He’s going 
to drown!
But then he rises like Poseidon and slams Ajay backwards and 
into the main pool. 
They fight doggedly on, weighed down by their soaking 
clothes.
Suddenly, Sherlock spots another of the photo-electric cells 
in the pool wall. 
He slashes his hand in front of the sensor and suddenly a 
waterfall thunders down from a spout above their heads, 
thudding onto Ajay and knocking him flat!
Sherlock staggers from the pool and races towards the hold-
all. 
Ajay drags himself from the water and gets the gun from where 
it landed in the corner. 
He turns and aims at Sherlock. 
Sherlock grabs the Thatcher bust and holds it out in front of 
him. 
Police sirens sound, very close. 
SHERLOCK
You’re out of time. So, tell me.

-- a big warehouse, stacked full of plaster busts - Stalin, 
Lenin, Brezhnev, Churchill etc. 
Physical flashback. 
An OLD RUSSIAN man with an ash-heavy cigarette is arranging a 
fresh batch of busts from their casts. They are, of course, 
the six Thatchers. 
He looks up as AJAY races towards him.
Ajay knocks him out with ruthless efficiency. 
Outside, the shouts of his pursuers. 
Ajay looks around desperately. He takes his A.G.R.A. memory 
stick from a chain round his neck and holds it in his shaking 
hand. 
Then he spots the Thatcher busts and an idea springs into his 
head. 
Swiftly he grabs the nearest one, carves a hole in the base 
of the still-wet plaster and then smooths it over.
He places the bust back on the shelf just as the doors open 
again and he’s surrounded by gun-wielding MEN. The lead one, 
a big bastard, smiles. It’s GOLD TEETH from the Embassy. He 
lifts the butt of his gun and brings it down - crash - onto 
Ajay’s head. 
Ajay drops to the floor and rolls into --

dusty sunlight pour through the barred windows.
AJAY is roped to a chair. His face is bruised and bleeding. 
GOLD TEETH stands over him. Another GUARD stands in the 
corner, grinning. 
Ajay cries out in agony as Gold Teeth works on him. 
GOLD TEETH
I love you. 
He laughs. 
GOLD TEETH (CONT’D)
Love, love, love.

GUARD (CONT’D)
We’ll come back later. 
The Torturer gathers his things. Horrible, glittering steel 
instruments. 
GOLD TEETH
What would he do if he knew, huh?
About the Englishwoman? 
The Guard grins. 
GUARD
What would you do to a traitor? 
Maybe we’ll tell him one day. If he 
lives that long.
Gold Teeth laughs. They go out, locking the heavy metal door 
after them. 
Ajay opens his swollen eyes and lifts his head from his 
chest. 
He was listening.
He gets out of the chair and walks back into --

The splendidly ruined Gothic splendour of an old London 
cemetery lit by a torch beam.
Someone walks past the crumbling pillars and angels. Ivy-
covered graves moulder in the silence. 
They part a clump of brambles, revealing the entrance to a 
tumbledown tomb. 
The newcomer pushes at the rusted metal door and enters the 
vault.

The inside of the tomb leans at an absurd angle, like a fun-
house. 
In the centre, a bronze figure is half-submerged in the 
floor. In the shadows, broken chairs, ancient wreaths, rotted 
flowers, long-forgotten coffins. 
The visitor comes in. It’s MARY. 
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
I’m an idiot. I know nothing. 
SHERLOCK steps from the shadows. 
MARY
I’ve been telling you that for 
ages. That was quite a text you 
sent. What the hell’s going on, 
Sherlock? 
SHERLOCK
I was so obsessed with Moriarty, I 
couldn’t see what was right under 
my nose. 
He holds out the memory stick. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I expected a pearl. 
Mary rushes towards him, grabs the stick from his hand. 
MARY
That’s - but that’s -
SHERLOCK
An A.G.R.A memory stick, yes. Like 
the one you gave John. So this must 
be another. Whose?

MARY
I don’t know. We all had one. But 
the others are - 
Haven’t you looked at what’s on it?
SHERLOCK
I glanced at it. I’d prefer to hear

MARY
There were four of us. 
SHERLOCK
Agents.
MARY
That’s the polite term.
Alex, Gabriel, me and Ajay. 
A.G.R.A.
SHERLOCK
You were good?
MARY
No.
A look from Sherlock.
MARY (CONT’D)
We were the best. 
Beat. 
MARY (CONT’D)
There was absolute trust between 
us. The memory sticks guaranteed 
it. 
SHERLOCK
How?
MARY
We all had one. Each containing all 
our aliases, background, 
everything. We could never be 
betrayed because we had everything 
we needed to destroy the other. 
SHERLOCK
And who did you work for?
MARY
Anyone who paid well. We were at 
the top of our game for years. Then 
it all ended. There was a coup in 
Georgia. Short-lived. The British 
Embassy in Tblisi was taken over. 
Lots of hostages.

Just another voice on the end of 
the phone. And a code word. “Ammo”.

Very wrong.

But we didn’t. 
A smoke bomb explodes. Mary fires the gun over the heads of 
the assembled and there’s instant anarchy. 
Bullets fly everywhere. 
GABRIEL is cut down before her. 
ALEX is grabbed and hurled to the ground.
There’s no sign of AJAY. 
Somehow, through the smoke and chaos, Mary makes her escape,

Six years ago. Feels like forever. 
I was the only one who made it out.
SHERLOCK
No. 
MARY
What?
She looks levelly at Sherlock. He plugs the memory stick into 
a laptop on the bronze effigy. 
SHERLOCK
I met someone tonight. The someone 
who’s been after the sixth 
Thatcher. 
On the screen, data screes past. Details of missions after 
mission, aliases, photos of Mary and her colleagues in 
different guises. 
Sherlock pauses the image. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
This is him. 
Mary’s eyes widen. 
MARY
Ajay! That’s Ajay. He’s alive?
SHERLOCK
Very much so. 
MARY
(gabbling)
I can’t believe it! That’s amazing.  
I thought I was the only one. The 
only one left. Where is he now? I 
have to see him -
SHERLOCK
You kept the memory sticks safe, 
presumably?
MARY
Of course. It was our insurance. 
Each memory stick had to be well-
hidden. Above all else, they were 
never to be carried personally. 
That’s what we agreed. Except...

With all of A.G.R.A’s old aliases 
on it. Why? 
MARY
I don’t know. 
SHERLOCK
Six years since Tbilisi. Where’s he 
been? 
Mary shrugs. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I’m sorry to say this, Mary. But he 
wants you dead. 
MARY
But...but we were like family.
SHERLOCK
(bleakly)
Families fall out. The memory stick 
is the best way to track you down. 
You’re the only other survivor. It 
must be you he wants. And he’s 
already killed once to find the 
Thatcher bust.

SHERLOCK
It’s what he believes. 
Mary sinks into a chair. Sighs.

me.

Oh, Mary. No human action is ever 
truly random. An advanced grasp of 
the mathematics of probability, 
mapped on to a thorough 
apprehension of human psychology 
and the known dispositions of any 
given individual, can reduce the 
variables considerably. I know of 
at least fifty eight techniques to 
refine a seemingly infinite array 
of randomly generated 
possibilities, down to the smallest 
number of feasible variables.

But they’re all really difficult, 
so instead I just stuck a tracer 
inside the memory stick.

JOHN (CONT’D)
I used to. 
MARY
I just didn’t know what else to do. 
JOHN
You could have stayed. Talked to 
me. That’s what couples are 
supposed to do. 
(almost to himself)
Work things through. 
MARY
Yes. Yes, of course. 
JOHN
I’m...I’m not a very good man, 
Mary. But I think I might be a bit 
better than you give me credit for.

MARY
All the time. You’re always a good

Real pain in John’s eyes. 
JOHN
Why?
MARY
You never judge. You never 
complain. I don’t deserve you. 
SHERLOCK (O.S.)
(kindly)
I swear I’ll keep my vow, Mary. 
Mary turns, Sherlock is in the doorway.
SHERLOCK
But in London. I know my turf. My 
city. 
He comes into the room, closing the latticed door behind him.
SHERLOCK
Come home and everything will be 
alright. I promise you. 
Mary nods. Takes John’s hands.
Suddenly, a tiny red laser dot appears on her forehead! 
SHERLOCK
Get down!!
Sherlock hurls himself at her and they roll across the floor 
just as the door explodes into shards. 
Thup!
Thup!
Thup!
Bullets slap into the wall. 
John up-ends the table and the three of them crouch behind 
it. 
The door is kicked open. AJAY is briefly silhouetted in the 
doorway. Then he rolls over into the room, brandishing two 
guns. 
AJAY
Hello again. 
MARY
Ajay!

who got out. 
She risks a peek around the table. 
Thup!
A bullet smashes into the woodwork.
Sherlock holds out his hand for the gun. 
Mary frowns. Then gives it to him. 
SHERLOCK
How did you find us? 
He aims at the main light. 
AJAY
By following you, Sherlock Holmes. 
You are clever. You found her. But 
I found you. So...perhaps - not so 
clever. And now here we are. At 
last. 
Bang! 
Sherlock shoots the bulb out and the room is plunged into 
darkness. 
AJAY

Touché! 
There are frantic scuttling sounds as Ajay adjusts to the new

AJAY
She thought I was dead. I might as 
well have been. 
Mary takes the gun from Sherlock.
MARY
But it was always us. The four of 
us.
AJAY
Oh yes. 
MARY
So why are you trying to kill me? 
AJAY
Do you know how long they kept me 
prisoner? What they did they to me? 
They tortured Alex to death. I can 
still hear the sound of his back 
breaking. But you? Where were you?
MARY
That day at the Embassy. I escaped. 
Ajay laughs his mirthless laugh. 
 MARY (CONT’D)
I lost sight of you too. So - you 
explain? Where were you? 
AJAY
I got out. For a while. Long enough 
to hide my memory stick. I didn’t 
want that to fall into their hands. 
I was loyal, you see. 
(bitter)
Loyal to my friends. But they took 
me. Tortured me. Not for 
information. Not for anything 
except fun. They thought I’d give 
in. Die. But I didn’t. I lived. And 
eventually they forgot about me. 
Rotting in a cell somewhere. Six 
years they kept me there. Until one 
day...I saw my chance. 
(grimly)
And I made them pay. And, you know, 
all the time I was there, I kept 
picking up things. Little whispers. 
Laughter. Gossip.

How the clever agents had been

MARY
Me? 
A car goes past and the room is briefly illuminated by its 
headlights.
Ajay shifts forward on his behind to within inches of the 
table, the barrels of his guns glinting in the dim light from 
the corridor. 
Quick as a flash, Mary’s pistol is aiming at him. 
Ajay’s finger tightens on the trigger. Mary responds in kind. 
MARY (CONT’D)
You know I’ll kill you too. You 
know I will, Ajay. 
John looks at his wife. She’s transformed. A killer. It’s 
disquieting. 
JOHN
Come on, come on! Take it easy. 
Let’s just keep this calm, ok? Keep 
it calm.
AJAY
You think I care if I die? I’ve 
dreamed of killing you. Every night 
for six years. Of squeezing the 
life out of your treacherous lying 
throat -
JOHN
You heard what she said. It wasn’t 
her! Whatever you think, it wasn’t 
her who betrayed you!
MARY
I swear to you, Ajay.
AJAY 
I will kill you! I’ll watch the 
life run out of you...
Sherlock emerges from behind the table, hands raised.
SHERLOCK
What did you hear, Ajay? Tell me! 
What exactly did you hear when you 
were a prisoner?
AJAY
What did I hear? “I love you”. 
Every day. As they tore into me. 
“Love. Love. Love”.

Suddenly, silhouetted in the doorway - little KARIM, holding 
a tray of tea.
Ajay glances round - and from the corridor appears an armed 
MOROCCAN POLICEMAN. 
He fires - 
MARY
No, no, no, no!!
-- and Ajay is slammed against the wall.  
Mary races over to him. Weakly, he aims the gun at her. 
There’s a moment -
- then Ajay’s eyes roll up in his head. He’s dead.
Karim drops the tray of tea. And starts to cry.

MARY (V.O.)
You know when you’re in a plane

She looks at him very directly. 
John swallows. 
Time to exit this slightly absurd, slightly sexy situation. 
He’s aware of his responsibilities. Especially as a new 
father --
‘E’ walks forward, takes a pen and scrap of paper from her

Then he takes out his phone and quite casually open his 
contacts. 
Enters a new contact:
‘E’.
He types in the number. 
Stares at it for a moment. 
Then, fatefully, he taps ‘send message’. 
And texts the simple word ‘Hey’. 
From upstairs, the baby starts crying. 
John’s about to put his phone away when it beeps. 
He checks it.

The little 666 tattooed on her 
forehead. 
JOHN
That’s ‘The Omen’. 
MARY
So?
JOHN
You said it was like ‘The 
Exorcist’. You can’t have them 
both. She can’t be the Antichrist

The baby starts screaming in the next room. 
MARY

Can’t she? 
She throws back the duvet and shuffles towards the door. 
MARY (CONT’D)
Coming, darling. I’m coming...

glances over at his phone on the bedside table. 
He pulls his phone towards him and checks the texts. 
On his phone - 
‘It’s been too long’
John flicks a guilty glance towards the door through which 
Mary left.

Yeah. 
JOHN
I’ll take her.

famous market at Baghdad -
SHERLOCK
Oh yes. I know this one. Funny...
VIVIAN
What?
SHERLOCK
My brother was just...
He loses focus for a moment. 
SHERLOCK
I don’t have time for fairy tales.

I’m just like the merchant in the

inevitable but I’ve always been 
looking over my shoulder. Always 
expecting to see the grim figure 
of...
MARY (O.S.)
Death? 
MARY emerges from the shadows.
SHERLOCK
Hello, Mary.
MARY
Hey.
SHERLOCK
John?
MARY
On his way.

You were Ammo? You were the voice

SHERLOCK
Using A.G.R.A. as a private 
assassination unit.

SHERLOCK
Let me guess. Selling secrets? 
VIVIAN
(shrugs)
Seemed churlish to refuse. Worked 
very well for a few years. Bought a 
nice cottage in Cornwall off the 
back of it. But...the Ambassador in 
Tbilisi found out. I thought I’d 
had it. Then she was taken hostage 
in that coup. 
(laughs)
Couldn’t believe my luck! That 
bought me a little time.  
SHERLOCK
Then you found out your boss was 
sending A.G.R.A. in.
VIVIAN
Very handy. They were always such 
reliable killers. 
She glances at Mary. 
SHERLOCK
What you didn’t know, Mary, was 
that she also tipped off the 
hostage-takers. 
VIVIAN
Lady Smallwood gave the order. But 
I sent another one, to the 
terrorists. With a nice little clue 
about her code-name, should anyone 
have an enquiring mind. 
(nods to Sherlock)
Seemed to do the trick. 
MARY
And you thought all your troubles 
were over. 
VIVIAN
I was tired. Tired of the...mess of 
it all. I wanted some peace. Some 
clarity. The hostages were killed. 
A.G.R.A. too. Or so I thought. My 
secret was safe. 
Beat. 
VIVIAN (CONT’D)
But apparently not.
(to Mary)
Just a little peace, that’s all you 
wanted too, wasn’t it? A home. A 
family. Really, I understand. So 
just let me get out of here, ok?

VIVIAN looks down at her gun.
VIVIAN
I was never a field agent. I always 
thought I’d be rather good. 
SHERLOCK
You handled the Tbilisi job very 
well. Pretty impressive. 
VIVIAN
Thanks. 
SHERLOCK
For a secretary. 
VIVIAN
What?
SHERLOCK
Can’t have been easy. All these 
years. Sitting in the background, 
keeping your mouth shut when you 
knew you were cleverer than most 
people in the room. 
VIVIAN
I didn’t do this out of jealousy.
SHERLOCK
No? Same old drudge, day in, day 
out. Never getting out there where 
the excitement was. Going back to 
that little flat in Wigmore Street -
Vivian looks startled.

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
They’ve taken up the pavement 
outside the post office there. The 
local clay on your shoes is very 
distinctive. Yes, back to your 
little flat - 
VIVIAN
How do you - ?
SHERLOCK
On your salary? Has to be modest. 
You blew all the money on that 
cottage, didn’t you? And - what are 
you - widowed or divorced?
Before Vivian can speak, Sherlock gestures towards her hand. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Wedding ring, at least thirty years 
old but moved to a different 
finger. So you’re sentimentally 
attached but not still married. I’d 
favour widowed given the number of 
cats you share your life with. 
MARY
(concerned)
Sherlock...
SHERLOCK
Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell 
judging by the hairs on your 
cardigan. A divorcee is more likely 
to look for a new partner, a widow 
to fill the void in her life left 
by a dead husband. 
Vivian’s expression hardens. 
MARY
Sherlock, don’t!
But Sherlock is grand-standing, enjoying himself. 
SHERLOCK
Pets do that, or so I’m told. And 
there’s clearly no-one new in your 
life or you wouldn’t be spending 
your Friday nights in the Aquarium. 
That probably accounts for the 
drink problem too. The slight 
tremor in your hands, the red wine 
smile ghosting the top lip. So, 
yes, I’d say jealousy was your 
motive in the end. To prove you 
were good enough. To make up for 
the inadequacy of your little life. 
A group of POLICE led by LESTRADE pile into the Aquarium. 
MYCROFT appears behind them.

(to Vivian)
Well, Mrs Norbury. I must admit, 
this is unexpected. 
Sherlock holds out his hand for Vivian’s gun. It sags in her 
grip. 
SHERLOCK
Vivian Norbury. Who outsmarted them 
all. All except Sherlock Holmes. 
(smug)
There’s no way out. 
VIVIAN
So it would seem. You’ve seen right 
through me, Mr Holmes.
SHERLOCK
It’s what I do. 
VIVIAN
Maybe I can still surprise you. 
She re-aims the gun at Sherlock.
LESTRADE
Come on. Be sensible. 
Vivian seems to consider this. She gazes levelly at Sherlock.
VIVIAN
No. I don’t think so.
Time seems to slow down. 
Mary looks at Sherlock. 
Vivian’s finger tightens on the trigger. 
Time seems to stand still.
Mary throws herself in front of Sherlock. 
BOOOOOOOM!!! 
The gun fires.
The bullet spins, spins, spins in slo-mo.
There’s a strange standstill moment as the blast echoes 
around the aquarium.
Then Mary crumples to the floor. 
Vivian drops the gun. 
VIVIAN (CONT’D)
Surprise.

Get an ambulance!!
Mycroft immediately calls for help. 
Suddenly, JOHN pushes his way inside past the police. He 
takes in the scene in an instant. 
JOHN
MARY!!
MARY
Oh John...
He dashes to her side.
JOHN
Stay with me, Mary. Don’t worry. 
He tries to staunch the blood. But it’s flooding out of her. 
MARY
Come on, doctor...You can do better 
than that. 
She smiles weakly.
JOHN
Mary -
MARY
Oh God, John. I think this it.
JOHN
Nononononono....
MARY
You made me so happy. You gave me

SHERLOCK
Yes. You did. 
MARY
Sorry...sorry for shooting you that

SHERLOCK
I know. 
MARY
Think we’re even now. Ok?
SHERLOCK
Ok.

Definitely even.
She squeezes John’s hand.

And you. You were my whole world. 
She closes her eyes. Then they flicker open again. 
MARY (CONT’D)
Being Mary Watson was the only life 
worth living. 
JOHN
Mary...
MARY
Thank you.
She’s gone. 
John sinks his head onto hers and sobs and sobs and sobs. 
At last, Sherlock puts his hand on John’s shoulder. 
John looks up, his eyes red with grief and fury. 
JOHN
You made a vow. You swore it.

MYCROFT comes in.  
He rubs his eyes wearily, goes to the fridge. Nothing in. 
By the phone on the wall there are various take-away menus. 
He reaches for one then spots the calender next to it. 
The 13th has been ringed.
He checks his watch.
Sighs.

Sherlock glances down at the table. His laptop is open on his

Work is the best antidote to

Yes. Yes, I expect you’re right.

ENVELOPE, PRINTED ADDRESS, MARKED PRIVATE AND PERSONAL
SHERLOCK
What’s that?
MRS HUDSON
Oh, I brought it up. Got mixed in 
with mine.

From a lawyer. Keeps A dog at the

RIPS OPEN THE ENVELOPE. A DVD FALLS INTO HIS HAND. THE WORDS

Mrs Hudson catches sight of it.
MRS HUDSON
Oh God. Is that - ?

Must be! I knew it couldn’t end 
there! I knew Moriarty made plans!

too. So...

Rosie. 
MOLLY
Oh.

Just wondered how things were

Offering to help. 
SHERLOCK
Yes?
MOLLY
That he’d rather have anyone but 
you. 
Sherlock’s face falls. 
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Anyone.
She tries to smile but just looks sad. Slowly, she closes the

Sherlock turns away, deflated. 
He trudges out onto the street. 
On Sherlock’s face, as he walks, we hear Mary’s words

Save John Watson. Save him, 
Sherlock. SAVE HIM. 
Back on Sherlock, walking. The camera drifts down his body, 
settling on his shoes as he walks.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
When does the path we walk on lock

become a river, with only one 
destination?
