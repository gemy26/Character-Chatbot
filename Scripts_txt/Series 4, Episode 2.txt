INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

1
John, lying there, awake. Grey morning light.
ELSA
(V.O.; slight German 
accent)
Tell me about your morning. Start 
from the beginning.
CUT TO:
INT. CONSULTING ROOM - DAY
2
2
John and Elsa, his new therapist.
John: in a dark place. Barely able to communicate, closed 
off, a terrible blankness.
Elsa: a permanent smiling calm, sharp, glittery eyes.
JOHN
I woke up.
ELSA
How did you sleep?
JOHN
I didn’t. I don’t.
ELSA
You just said you woke up
JOHN
I stopped lying down.
INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

3
Close on John as he sits up. Collects himself. Looks to the 
other side of the bed. 
A moment of remembering (though we stay close on his face.)

ELSA
Alone?
JOHN
Of course, alone!

INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - DAY

5
Back on John’s face, looking at other side of the bed.
Wider: he’s not alone in the bed. A coil of hair on the 
pillow, a female form under the covers.
CUT TO:
INT. CONSULTING ROOM - DAY

ELSA
I meant Rosie. Your daughter.
A flicker on John’s face. Misjudged that.
JOHN
She’s with friends.
ELSA
Why?
JOHN
I can’t always cope. 
ELSA: silent, faintly smiling, waiting for more.
JOHN
Last night wasn’t ... good.
CUT TO:
INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

7
John, knotting his tie in the mirror. A female figure passes 
behind him. His eyes flick towards her - a haunted look.
CUT TO:
INT. CONSULTING ROOM - DAY

ELSA
That’s understandable.
JOHN
Why? Why’s it understandable? Why 
does everything have to be 
understandable? How about some 
things are unacceptable and we just 
say that?
Elsa’s calm smile doesn’t flicker. John kind of wishes it 
would.
ELSA
I only mean it’s okay.

JOHN
I’m letting down my daughter, how 
in the world is that okay?
ELSA
You just lost your wife.
JOHN
Rosie just lost her mother. 
ELSA
You’re holding yourself to an 
unreasonable standard.
JOHN
No. I’m failing to.
CUT TO:
INT. JOHN’S KITCHEN - DAY
9
9
John sits, sombre, at the table, sipping his coffee. Behind, 
the woman - now dresses - busies herself.
ELSA
(V.O.)
Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?
The woman places her hand of John’s shoulder. John takes her 
hand, kisses it.
JOHN
Why would I?
CUT TO:
INT. CONSULTING ROOM - DAY
10
10
ELSA
Do you?
John, stony-faced, silent.
JOHN
I haven’t seen him. Nobody’s seen 
him, he’s locked himself up in his 
flat, God knows what he’s doing.
ELSA
Do you blame him?
JOHN
No.
ELSA
Why not?

I don’t blame him. I don’t think

ELSA
So there’s no one you talk to?  
Confide in?

No one.

INT. JOHN’S KITCHEN - DAY

11
John, heading to the door, looks back. Now talks to the 
woman. (We’re now over her shoulder, as she sits at the 
kitchen table.)
JOHN
Picking up Rosie this afternoon. 
After I’ve seen my therapist. Got a 
new one, I’m seeing her today.
The woman speaks from off-camera. Instantly, her voice is 
familiar.
WOMAN
Are you going to tell her about me?
JOHN
... No.
WOMAN
Why not?
JOHN
I can’t.
WOMAN
Why not?
JOHN
Because I can’t, you know I can’t. 
She thinks you’re dead.
Now pushing in on the woman, the reveal.
It’s Mary, sitting there, staring at him.
MARY
John, you’ve got to remember, it’s 
important. I am dead.
John flinches, like he’s been struck.
MARY
Please, for your own sake, for 
Rosie’s. This isn’t real, I’m dead.
John, not answering, can’t even make eye contact.  
MARY
John, look at me. I’m not here, you 
know I’m not.
John, nothing for a moment. Then.

JOHN
See you later.
He goes. As he clears frame, we see there’s no one at the  
table.
On the empty chair.
ELSA
(V.O.)
Is there anything you’re not 
telling me?
CUT TO:
INT. CONSULTING ROOM - DAY
12
12
JOHN
No.
His eyes flick briefly to beyond her chair.
And there’s Mary, watching from the shadows, tears streaming 
down her face.
ELSA
Who were you looking at?
JOHN
No one.
ELSA
You keep glancing to my left.
JOHN
There’s no one there. I was just 
... looking away.
ELSA
There is a difference between 
looking away and looking to - I 
tend to notice these things.
(Smiles)
Now I am reminding you of your 
friend, I think?
JOHN
That’s not necessarily a good 
thing.
ELSA
Has he attempted to make contact 
with you?
JOHN
No.
ELSA
How can you be sure? He may have 
tried.

(CONTINUED)


JOHN
If Sherlock Holmes tries to get in 
touch, it’s not something you can 
fail to notice.
As if on cue:
The clatter of a helicopter above. Now police sirens wailing 
outside, tyres screeching on tarmac.
A louder screech, a squeal of brakes, an impact just outside 
the room. A dustbin somersaults past the window.
John is already out of his chair. 
CUT TO:
EXT. ELSA’S HOUSE - DAY
13
13
John comes striding out of the front door of a neat little 
suburban house, in a nice little housing estate (Elsa’s 
consulting room is in her home.)
He finds:
Two police cars. They’ve screeched to a halt. 
Above, a helicopter.
And parked at a crazy angle on the font lawn, is a red sports 
car, the driver’s door swinging open -
Close on John, staring at who is emerging from the car - 
astonished.
Elsa is now at his shoulder.
ELSA
Well now! Won’t you introduce me?
John, stepping forward into close up. Whoever he’s staring, 
he can’t quite believe it. The last person he expected!

INT. BOARD ROOM - NIGHT
15
15
At the windows, night time London, far below. Over this:
THREE YEARS AGO.
We are looking through at window. Reflected, out of focus, a 
man, staring out. We can make out a slight, bald figure.
There is a murmur of conversation in this room, a gentle 
hubbub.

(CONTINUED)


CORNELIA 
Mr. Smith? 
Roll focus, fast! The reflected figure snaps into sharpness. 
A gleaming bald head, almost eerily hairless. Black, 
sparkling eyes, and a gleeful rictus smile crammed with a 
jumble of miss-matched teeth.
This is Culverton Smith. 
He turns to the woman who spoke at his shoulder, and it’s  
like he threw a switch, because the goblin grin is gone. He 
looks restrained, solemn, wise. Just a little dead-eyed.
Now, very fast, almost subliminal, barely more than blips - a 
set of fast-cutting video clips, too close on the screen, 
liney and grainy -
- Culverton Smith laughing on a chat show -
- Culverton Smith being interviewed on a red carpet
- Culverton Smith talking earnestly on Newsnight.
(We will use these Video Blips as punctuation throughout - 
when Culverton Smith is seen or mentioned. It’s as if his 
fame has impact, a jumble of associations. Like when you meet 
someone famous and you can’t help thinking of the times 
you’ve seen them.)
Wider: Cornelia his PA, is a few feet behind him.
CORNELIA
Whenever you’re ready.
Culverton Smith looks round the room.
Six people, three men, three women. 
Closer on one of the women, laughing. This is Faith. She 
looks vital, nervy. Blonde (or light coloured) hair, brightly 
coloured spectacles. In her thirties. In one hand she grips a 
walking cane. Like her clothes, it is stylish, ever-so-
slightly flamboyant. As Culverton Smith looks at her, she 
throws back her head and laughs at something someone just 
said.
Culverton Smith smiles for a moment, fondly, maybe a little 
sadly -
- then turns back to Cornelia.
CULVERTON SMITH 
Now please.
Cornelia nods 
Culverton Smith turns back to the window -

- as his face swings back into the reflection, that grin is
back.
On Cornelia, turning, phone discreetly at her ear.
CORNELIA
Bring them through.
He steps out of shot. Leaving us with a shot of two magazine 
covers. Culverton Smith grins from the cover of the Radio 
Times (”Back in Business”) and glowers from a copy of Time 
(”Serious Money”.)
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
16
16
A thick-set SECURITY MAN folding his phone away.
Wider: a long, quiet corridor in the same building - rows of 
windows, rows of doors, silent. Semi-darkness - the only 
light glimmers from the streets outside, and streams through 
the one opened door.  The Security Man stands opposite this 
door. 
He glances through the door, gives a little nod to someone.
The squeaking of wheels. Now an eerie procession out of the 
door.

Nurses, gloved, gowned, face-masked - and each one pushing 
hospital drip feed. The casters squeak in the silence of the 
corridor.
Over this:
CULVERTON SMITH
(V.O.)
It’s difficult having such good 
friends.
CUT TO:
INT. BOARD ROOM - NIGHT
17
17
CULVERTON SMITH, now standing at the end of the meeting 
table. The others are seated round it - six of them. Three 
men, three women.
Culverton moving round the table. As he passes each person, 
he makes some contact with them - squeezing a shoulder, 
patting a back. 
CULVERTON SMITH
Friends are people you want to 
share with. Friends and family.
On the word “family” he’s passing behind Faith. A squeeze of 
the shoulder, and smile from Faith.
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The eerie procession of nurses. Closer on the drip feed bags.

17B
Culverton, at the end of the table now, hands spreading - a 
man making a reasonable appeal.
CULVERTON SMITH (V.O.)
But here’s a question: what’s the 
very worst thing you can do to your 
very best friends?
An exchange of glances round the table. Ivan smiles, 
friendly.
IVAN
Something on your mind? 
CULVERTON SMITH
Yes. Oh, yes.

IVAN
Anything you tell us, stays in this 
room. I think I speak for everyone.
A murmur of assent. Loyal friends, a little offended that he 
would.
FAITH
Well? What is the worst thing you 
could do?
CULVERTON SMITH 
Tell them your darkest
secret.
More glances. Questions forming on lips.
CULVERTON SMITH (CONT’D)
Because if you tell them ... and
they decide they’d rather not know 
... you can’t take it back. You 
can’t un-say it. Once you open your 
heart, you can’t close it again.
Silence now. What the hell is he talking about? On Culverton- 
Smith. Smirks.
CULVERTON SMITH (CONT’D)
Kidding! Of course you can!
He gives a little nod to Cornelia, who steps to the door, 
opens it -
- we can’t see into the shadowed corridor - but we hear the
squeaking of the approaching casters.
They all stare as the nurses start wheeling the drip feed  
units into the room,
CULVERTON SMITH (CONT’D)
Please roll up your right sleeves.  
(Smiles, amiable)
Just a little bit of insurance.
The nurses as they move calmly round the room, positioning  
each dripfeed behind an occupied chair.  
On Faith: her earlier cheeriness gone, now a little thrown. 
Staring at the bags, curious and unnerved. It comes out as 
belligerence.
FAITH
I don’t understand. What is that?
IVAN
TD 12.
Ivan: bemused, as he stares at the bags. Like he’s surprised 
to see them here. This conversation has taken a turn he 
didn’t expect.

Didn’t exactly know who’d you’d be

He gives a nervous little laugh. A few others join in. Faith, 
grim-faced, silences them with:
FAITH
You mean you didn’t ask?
On Ivan: colours, embarrassed. Fair point.  
CULVERTON SMITH 
Is everybody ready? 
FAITH 
No!

crowd.
INT. FAITH’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Faith’s hands slam on to the desk, as if to steady herself, 
her walking cane falls to the floor -
- and we see that her right sleeve is rolled up.
She looks at it, touches her hand to the exposed flesh. Oh 
God!
CUT TO:
VIDEO BLIP - Closer on Culverton Smith as he waves - that 
jumble-toothed grin.

23
Close on a man’s shirt-sleeve, as it is unbuttoned, rolled 
back.
Wider: Faith is watching this in astonishment - one of the 
men further down the table is actually preparing for the 
injection!
FAITH 
(At Culverton Smith)
This is obscene. 
CULVERTON SMITH
All I’m doing, Faith, is getting 
something off my chest without 
getting it on yours.

He takes the seat next to, angling it towards - just a bit 
too intimate.
CULVERTON SMITH
What you are about to hear me say, 
may horrify you, but you will 
forget it.
He has taken her right arm, so delicately, and is calmly 
unbuttoning her sleeve. She’s unresisting, but rigid in her 
chair.
CULVERTON SMITH
If you think about it, civilisation 
has always depended on a measure of 
elective ignorance.
Faith: caught in his eyes for a moment

his arm round one of them.

- the same motion in reverse as Faith seats herself in her
chair. She places her hands on the desk in front of her,
looks at them meditatively. Her bared arm
On her face, a flicker of pain, of regret. 
She turns that arm over. There is a bandaid on her underarm,  
just like you get when you’ve had an injection
She touches the sticking plaster ...

Culverton Smith, strolling round the table - the perfect, 
genial host.
The others are now all hooked up to their drip feeds. Little 
beeping machines, connected to the machines, sit on table, 
one in front of each of them.
The robed and gowned nurses are filing out of the room.
On Faith, so troubled, watching them go...
The door clicks shut.

the drug in your bloodstream at 
exactly the right level. Nothing 
that is happening to you now will 
stay with you for more than a few 
minutes. 
His eyes flick to Faith. Smiles.

Faith’s eyes go to the device. It is surmounted by a dial. To 
one side of it is a little red button.
Culverton Smith, now moving round the table - checking the 
dripfeeds, patting the occasional back...
CULVERTON SMITH
I’m going to share something with 
you now. Something personal and of 
importance to me. I have a need to 
confess - but you, I think, might 
have a need to forget.
He stops by Faith, places a hand on her shoulder.

He looks to Faith, who looks daggers back at him.

For the people in this room. For 
millions of people I have never

that wouldn’t exist, if it weren’t 
for me. If life is a balance sheet - 
and it is - I believe I am in 
credit. However. I have a situation 
that needs to be ... managed. I 
have a problem - and there is only 
one way I can solve it. 
A silence. Then:

CULVERTON SMITH 
I’m terribly sorry. But I need to

The room chills. No one speaks for a long moment. Finally, in 
the freezing calm, it is Faith who speaks.
FAITH
Who?
On Culverton: about to speak. Freeze-frame, the frame burns 
out into:
Very fast sequence of cuts:
VIDEO BLIP - Culverton Smith on the panel of a talent show, 
arguing.
Wider - everything jarring now, sickening, slanting camera 
angles, almost like the room is spinning - 
- Ivan sits, frozen at what he’s just heard, sweating, hankie 
at his brow.
- one other nurse is already there, disconnecting one of the
men from his drip feed -
VIDEO BLIP - Culverton Smith joggling along, on charity fun 
run.

streaming down her face -

CULVERTON SMITH 
(From off) 
Faith. 
Her dreaded father stands in the doorway, compassionate.  
She recoils, but he steps to her, folding her in his arms. 
CULVERTON SMITH 
It’s okay, darling girl, hush. In   
five minutes you won’t remember why  
you’re crying. Everyone else is 
fine, they’re all going to the pub.
(Like a catch phrase)
It’s on me!
On his face as he hugs her. His beady little eyes flick to: 
The note on the desk. 
I need to kill someone. 
Who? 
He steps towards the note, picks it up. Shows i t to her.
CULVERTON SMITH 
Don’t you think I should take this?  
It’s only going to upset you. 
Faith looks at the note in his hand. She puts her hand out  
for it. He doesn’t respond.  
A moment of stand-off 
On the note, closing on the word Who? 
Now, voice over. Whispered, tremulous, barely recognisable as 
the same woman.
FAITH
(V.O.)
One word, Mr. Holmes - and it 
changed my world for ever.

INT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

A figure, silhouetted against the window.
A pair of hands clasping and re-clasping on the handle of a 
walking cane. A bowed head over it. The hair hanging round 
the face is now jet black, lank. 
FAITH
Just one word.
Some time has passed since we last saw her. She seems 
thinner, more intense. Now dressed entirely in black. Only 
the walking cane is unchanged.
221b: The fire is crackling in the hearth, rain is thrashing 
at the windows. The rooms might seem a bit darker than normal 
- there is the blue flickering light of a television. John’s
accustomed chair is empty.
SHERLOCK
What word?
On Sherlock. He’s in his usual chair, a dressing gown thrown 
over his clothes. 
A moment on him, because he looks very different. Unkempt, 
stubbled, bleary, more troubled and abstracted. But it’s 
deeper than that. He’s pale and thin, dark-eyed, sitting 
twisted in his chair. This is Sherlock Holmes as a beautiful 
ruin: a haunted shell of a man.
FAITH
A name.
SHERLOCK
What name?
Finally, she raises her head. No make-up. Without it she 
seems gaunt, harrowed. Barely recognisable as the same woman. 
She looks at him, those dark, sad eyes: such pain. She looks 
like a match for Sherlock.
FAITH
I can’t remember.
Sherlock: silent, regarding her thoughtfully. He holds up his 
phone - on it, a picture of Faith with Culverton Smith. In 
the picture she looks like she did in the Board Room scene - 
almost a completely different woman.)
SHERLOCK
You no longer top up your tan, and  
your roots are showing. Letting  
yourself go? 
Sherlock’s POV: he lowers the phone, to reveal the very 
different Faith in the seat opposite.

FAITH
Do you ever look in the mirror and 
want to see someone else?
SHERLOCK 
No. Do you own an American car?
FAITH
I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK
No, not American. A left hand 
drive, that’s what I mean.
FAITH
No. Why do you ask?
SHERLOCK
Not sure, actually, I probably 
noticed something. 
Sherlock’s POV of Faith. With a blackboard squeak, a chalk 
line draws itself down the screen and points itself at the 
hem of Faith’s skirt, on the left. 
Sherlock frowns at the line, cocks his head, like he’s trying 
to understand it. He looks down at the him of her (long) 
skirt, where the arrow points.
He waves his hand in front of his face, as if batting away a 
fly -
- and the chalk puffs into chalk dust.
Sherlock pauses a moment, looking at the hand he just waved 
with. It’s shaking - a palpable tremor. He clenches his fist, 
releases. Tremor still there.
FAITH
You okay?
SHERLOCK
Of course, you don’t own a car do 
you? You don’t need one - you’re  
living in isolation, no human 
contact, no visitors - 
Sherlock springs up, goes to the window -
- as he moves, he brushes past the coffee table next to him.  
Cutting closer on it: a hypodermic syringe rocks in the 
saucer of a cup of tea. (This fast, fleeting.)
Sherlock now looking out on to the rainy street. It isn’t 
clear what he’s looking at. 
FAITH
Okay, how do you know that?

SHERLOCK
(Indicating the paper)
Well it’s all here, isn’t it, look! 
And cost-cutting is obviously a 
priority for you - look at the size 
of your kitchen. Teeny tiny! Must   
be a bit annoying when you’re such  
a keen cook. 
FAITH
I don’t understand.
SHERLOCK
(Looks back at window)
No, hang on, I was looking out of 
the window - why was I doing that?
FAITH
I don’t know. 
SHERLOCK
Me neither, must’ve had a reason. 
It’ll come back to me.
(Back to the paper, 
turning it over, sniffing 
it, biting it)
Presumably you down-sized when you 
left your job, or maybe when you 
ended your relationship. I assume 
you abandoned the former because of 
your father, and the latter because 
your long term lover had ceased to 
take any interest in you. 
FAITH
(Colouring)
You can’t know that!
SHERLOCK
Course I can! There wasn’t anything 
physical going on, was there? Not  
for quite a while, in fact. 
(Points at the paper, like 
it’s all perfectly clear)
There, see, obvious.
He points to a section of the paper, as if this was all 
perfectly obvious.
FAITH
You can’t tell things like that 
from a piece of paper!
SHERLOCK
I think I just did, didn’t I? I’m 
sure that was me.

SHERLOCK
Dunno. It just sort of happens 
really, like a reflex. Can’t stop 
it!
Sherlock’s POV - she stares at him, silenced -
- and words appear round her, over her head and both 
shoulders. The same words three times. DAMP.
Sherlock waves them away, brushes remaining DAMP off her 
shoulder -
SHERLOCK
Coat.
FAITH
I don’t have a coat.
SHERLOCK
Yeah, that’s what I just noticed. 
Wonder why.
- just as the kitchen door slides open, revealing Wiggins
(the druggie from His Last Vow) looking as disreputable as
ever, but quite at home.
WIGGINS
Who are you talking to?
SHERLOCK
Piss off.
Sherlock slides the door shut in Wiggins face.  
FAITH 
So what do you think? 
SHERLOCK 
Of what? 
FAITH
My case? 
SHERLOCK
Oh, too weird for me. Go to the 
police. They’re excellent with this 
sort of complicated stuff. Tell 
them I sent you, that should get a 
reaction. N’night.
As he starts heading towards the kitchen, he picks up her 
handbag tosses it to her -
- and freeze!
The whole room just stops, the handbag hangs suspended in 
midair. 
Only Sherlock is still active. He turns, frowning to look at 
the suspended handbag.

A chalk line circles the suspended handbag, then a counter

a particular number of pounds (I’ll work it out) and stops, 
flashing red.
Sherlock steps towards suspended handbag, inspects the 
flashing red number.
He prods the handbag it sways in mid-air.

Sherlock frowns, something wrong here -

to the kitchen, and the room comes back to life, Faith 
catching her handbag.
FAITH
Please ... I have no one else to 
turn to.
SHERLOCK
Yes, but I’m far too busy at the 
moment, I have to drink a cup of 
tea.
WIGGINS
(Appearing at the kitchen 
door again.)
Is “cup of tea” code?
SHERLOCK
It’s a cup of tea.
WIGGINS
Because you might prefer some -
(Signs quotations marks)
- “coffee”.
FAITH
You’re my last hope.
She’s followed him into the kitchen -
- momentarily disconcerted. The 221B kitchen has all but been 
turned into a meth lab. Wiggins is working away, brewing up 
something awful.
SHERLOCK
Really? That’s bad luck, isn’t it?  
Good night, go away. 
WIGGINS 
What’s bad luck? 
SHERLOCK
Stop talking, it makes we aware of 
your existence.
Sherlock has grabbed a teacup - notices it’s got a couple of  
hypodermics in it. He “pours” them in the sick, like you  
might toss out cold coffee. 
WIGGINS 
I’ve always had bad luck, it’s  
congenital.

Faith goes sadly to the door, opens in on the howling, rainy 
night. No coat, no umbrella - she moves to step out.
SHERLOCK
Your life is not your own.
Faith startles, turns.
Sherlock has followed her. Now standing, crazed, agitated, at 
the foot of the stairs.
SHERLOCK
Keep your hands off it. Do you hear 
me? Off it. Off. It.
FAITH
Sorry, what? What are you talking 
about? 
SHERLOCK
Your skirt! 
FAITH
My skirt.
SHERLOCK
Look at it! The hem of your skirt, 
that’s what I noticed.
Sherlock vision: close on the hem of the skirt - creased, a 
little muddy.
SHERLOCK
Sorry, still catching up with my 
brain - it’s terribly fast. The 
markings, you see them?
She looks blankly at the hem of her skirt. A couple of 
slightly muddy, vertical creases.
SHERLOCK
You could only get those marks by 
trapping the hem of your skirt in a 
car door. But they’re  on the left.

SHERLOCK
There’s no taxi waiting in the 
street outside, that’s what I 
checked when I went to the window. 
And now you’ve got all the way to 
the door, and you’ve made no move 
to phone for one. And look at you - 
you didn’t even bring a coat. In 
this rain? All that might mean 
nothing, except for the angle of 
the scars on your left forearm - 
you know, under that sleeve you 
keep pulling down.
Her hand moves nervously to her forearm.
FAITH
You never saw them.
SHERLOCK
No, I didn’t, so thank you for 
confirming my hypothesis. I don’t 
really need to check that the angle 
is consistent with self harm, do I?
He puts his hand out, as if to take her arm, to look at them.
FAITH
No.
SHERLOCK
Keep your scars, I want to see your 
handbag.
FAITH
Why?
SHERLOCK
It’s too heavy.
She just stands there, not giving him the handbag.
SHERLOCK
You said I was your last hope. And  
now you’re heading out into the 
night, with no plan on how you’re 
getting home. And a gun.
On Faith. Caught out, nailed. Instinctively, her hand drift 
to her sleeve, pulls it down again.
Sherlock noticing that. Such a haunted look. He reaches for 
his own sleeve pulls it up.

Chips.

Chips?
He’s grabbing coat from the coat stand, tosses it at her.
Pulling on his own coat, he’s leading the way out the door.
SHERLOCK
You’re suicidal, you’re allowed 
chips - trust me, it’s about the 
only perk.
He’s holding the door open for her. A moment - she stares at 
him bemused. And then she heads out into the rain, pulling on 
the coat.
Sherlock, about to follow -
MRS HUDSON 
Sherlock ... 
Sherlock looks back. Mrs Hudson, standing just outside her 
door. Pale-faced, serious - these are terrible times.
MRS HUDSON
Are you going out?
SHERLOCK
I think I remember the way.
(Points at the door)
Through here, right?

SHERLOCK
See the fold in the middle? For the  
first few months you kept this 
hidden, folded inside a book - must  
have been a tightly packed shelf, 
going by the severity of the 
crease. 
Sherlock Vision: the note being placed inside a book, placed 
in a bookcase.
SHERLOCK
So obviously you were hiding it  
from someone who lived in the same 
house at a level of intimacy where 
privacy could not be assumed. 
Conclusion - relationship.
Sherlock Vision: the book on the shelf, of books. Two 
shadows, a man and woman, join in the middle as if kissing.
SHERLOCK
Not any more though.
The man’s shadow detaches, leaves her alone.
SHERLOCK
There’s a pin hole at the top of

his fingers)
The paper has been exposed to steam  
-
Sherlock Vision: a kettle boiling.
SHERLOCK
- and a variety of cooking smells -
Sherlock Vision: pans on hobs.
SHERLOCK

Not much, but enough to be sure 
that your kitchen window faces 
east.
Sherlock Vision: close on the paper, the bottom two thirds is 
fractionally sun-bleached, barely detectable.
He steps into the road (quiet, no traffic.)
SHERLOCK
Now, kitchen notice-boards -
He draws a rectangle in the air with his fingers, creating a 
chalk outline which just hangs there. When he complete the 
outline, it fills in and becomes a cork-board now hanging 
impossibly in midair.
SHERLOCK
By instinct, we place them at eye 
level where there’s natural light. 
He now pins the paper to the noticeboard.
SHERLOCK
Now look! Sunlight has only struck 
the bottom two thirds. The line of  
it is straight so we know the paper 
is facing the window - but because 
the top section is unaffected, we 
know sunlight only enters the room 
on a steep angle. 
He darts away from the hanging notice-board, and draws a  
window in the air about ten feet in front of it. Again the 
chalk outline fills in, to become an actual kitchen window, 
magically hanging there.
SHERLOCK
If sunlight were able to penetrate 
the room while the sun was lower in 
the sky, the paper would be equally 
faded, top to bottom. 
A beam of sunlight now shines through the hanging window. 
Sherlock, now standing behind the window moves his hand up, 
as the sun rises, causing the sun-beam to sweep down over the 
noticeboard.
Closer on the paper, as Sherlock waves the sunbeam up and 
down - the sunlight sweeps up and own over the pinned note 
like a searchlight, covering all of it.
SHERLOCK
But no, it only makes it when the 
sun is at its zenith - I’m betting 
because you live in narrow street, 
on the ground floor.
We now zoom in on the magic hanging window, to see a real 
daylight world through it - we’re looking out on a narrow 
street, with the sun peeping over the opposite rooftops.

Now if steeply angled sunlight

The sun beam, now steeply angled, isn’t making it as far the 
notice-board. It falls short, as a rectangle of golden 
sunlight on the wet black street.
Sherlock reaches over, grabs the window frame and pulls it 
through the air, closer to the notice board.
The rectangle of sunlight slides up the notice-board, falling 
over the bottom two-thirds of the note. The window and notice-
board now so much closer together.
SHERLOCK
The room is small.
On Faith, watching from the pavement - smiling now, 
indulgent, liking him.
A search light sweeps over them, Sherlock glances up - the

All those minute flecks of blood.
Sherlock Vision: close on the little bloodstain from the 
night she wrote the note ...
SHERLOCK
This one comes from the very first 
night - you can see where the pen 
marks go over it. I think you 
discovered that the pain stimulated 
your memory so you tried again 
later - several times, during the 
period you kept the note inside the 
book. You can see where the blood 
flecks transfer as you fold the 
paper over. I’m not an expert, but 
I assume if your lover had failed 
to notice an increasing number of 
scars over a period of months, the 
relationship was no longer

MYCROFT
Sherlock’s left his flat, first

tracked.
JOHN
Nice. It’s really quite touching 
how you hijack the machinery of the 
state to look after your own family 
- glad I pay my taxes, can I go to
bed now?
MYCROFT
(Bristling)
Sherlock gone rogue is a legitimate 
security concern. The fact that I’m 
his brother changes absolutely 
nothing. It didn’t the last time, 
and I assure you, it won’t with 
Sherlock. 
And as soon as its out of his mouth, he realises he slightly 
misspoke.
Lady Smallwood shoots him a slightly concerned look. Clearly 
knows what this is.
On John. What? That didn’t sound right. 
JOHN
... sorry, what?
MYCROFT
Please phone me if he gets in

Mycroft clicks off the phone.

Faith and Sherlock crossing one of the bridges over the

This is clearly a considerable time later, there’s even some

Sherlock is now carrying Faith’s cane, and she clings to his 
arm.
FAITH
How long have we been walking?
SHERLOCK
It’s a very long word.
FAITH
What is?
SHERLOCK
Bollocks. 
And he glances down -
- and the bridge has disappeared beneath him, his legs are 
thrashing over the river far below -
- he lets out a scream, clings madly to the wall.
FAITH
What’s wrong, what’s happening??
A whirl of images now - the three kids playing by the river, 
in the dazzle of sunlight (as seen in The Six Thatchers) 
burning out into an image of some gravestones (as seen in the 
next episode.)
Different angle. The bridge, of course, is still there - 
Sherlock is thrashing his feet on the concrete.

The sun is starting to rise - the sky whitening, a chilly

On Sherlock and Faith on one of the riverside benches, as the 
sun comes up. They’re munching on bacon rolls.
SHERLOCK
You said your life turned on one 
word.
FAITH
A name, yes.
SHERLOCK
Are you sure of that. Certain?
FAITH
Yes. I don’t remember the name, but 
I remember the feeling. One word 
changing my life.
SHERLOCK
And that is the impossible thing. 
Just that, right there.
FAITH
What’s impossible?
SHERLOCK
Names aren’t one word - they’re 
always at least two. Sherlock 
Holmes. Faith Smith. 
Faith frowning, considering that.
SHERLOCK
Santa Claus, Jeremy Kyle, Napoleon 
Bonaparte.
(Reflects)
Actually just Napoleon would do.
FAITH
Or Elvis.
SHERLOCK
I think we can rule them both out 
as targets.
FAITH
Okay, so, I got it wrong then. It 
wasn’t on one word, it can’t have 
been.
SHERLOCK
You’re an intelligent woman. 
Despite that, you have strong 
emotions - that’s clear from the 
fingernail indents in the palms of 
both your hands. 
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 2 - GREEN AMENDMENTS 10.06.16

And you remember, quite distinctly, 
that your whole life turned on one 
word. So that’s what happened, I 
don’t doubt it. But how can one 
word be a name? A name that you 
instantly recognised and tore your 
world apart?
FAITH
Okay. How?
SHERLOCK
No idea. Yet. But I don’t work for 
free.
And he holds out his hand, palm up, expectantly. She looks at 
it blankly.
FAITH
You take cash?
SHERLOCK
Not cash, no.
She looks blank for a moment, gets it. Moved for a moment. A 
furtive look round - no one looking. She slips her gun out of 
her handbag, gives it to him.
Sherlock rises, crosses to the river, Sherlock hurls the gun 
into the water. A distant splash. He stays there for a 
moment, his back to her.  Turns.
SHERLOCK
Taking your own life - interesting 
expression. Taking it from who? 
Because once its over, it won’t be 
you who misses it. Your own death 
is something that happens to 
everybody else.
He eyes move to a point beyond her, staring abstractedly.
She follows his look - for the first time we see that they’re 
just outside the Aquarium where Mary died.
Sherlock is looking out over the river again.
SHERLOCK
Your life is not your own. Keep 
your hands off it.
He looks at his own hands, trembling on the wall -
- and then gasps, grabs hold of the wall. The river below has 
vanished -
- in its place, impossibly, is the sky, with rapidly 
streaming clouds. Distantly, we hear a dog barking.
He hears Faith’s voice from the bench - distant, echoing.

What? What am I?
FAITH

SHERLOCK
Than who?
Close on Faith - and maybe it’s Sherlock’s druggy haze, but 
there’s ethereal, mysterious about her now.
FAITH
Anyone.
Suddenly, shockingly, Sherlock lets out an anguished cry, 
falls to his knees -
- and a blink of darkness later, he’s recovering. Shakes his 
head, almost embarrassed. Heaves himself to his feet.
SHERLOCK
Sorry. Sorry, I -
As he looks round, he breaks off.
The bench: she’s gone.
Sherlock looks round, momentarily disorientated.
SHERLOCK
Faith? Faith?
What? How long was out? Why would she just leave?
Gathers himself. Shivers in the morning cold, pulls his coat 
tighter around him. Starts to head away.
On his face, sad, troubled.
FLASHBACK (from The Six Thatchers):
Sherlock at the door, Molly speaking to him.
MOLLY
You don’t need to read it. I’m 
sorry, Sherlock. He says ... John 
said if you were to come round

He comes to a slow halt, frowning. A thought is surfacing.
He looks up -
A bill board, the other side of the street - Mary’s face on

Culverton Smith raises his head, looks directly at Sherlock.

SHERLOCK
Serial killer.
INDIGNANT MAN

Why not? He could be! Why shouldn’t

He looks curiously at the wall he’s leaning against. It seems 
to be carpeted. He prods the carpet -
- now pulling back, revolving, to see that Sherlock is now 
lying on the floor. He’s fallen over without even realising 
it. (We just carpet the wall, have him lean against it, then 
on the cut, switch so that he’s lying on the floor in the 
same position - could be quite a creepy effect.)

in his dressing gown, and looks he’s been living in a filthy 
cave. He’s flailing with a gun
SHERLOCK
I see you stand like greyhounds in

Straining upon the start.

dear? Because they know you.
SHERLOCK

Who’s this one? Is she a new 
person? I’m against new people.
Elsa looks with mild interest at Sherlock - we now notice she 
has a phone at her ear.
ELSA
Excuse me a moment.
JOHN
She’s my therapist.
SHERLOCK
Awesome. Do you do block bookings?
Sherlock blunders through to the consulting room.
John is looking at the red sports car parked on the lawn. Way 
more flash and expensive than makes sense.

She slams the front door shut, storms off. John winces at the 
force. He follows her through to the consulting room -

ELSA
Sorry, I answered your phone - you 
were busy. I think you will want to 
take it.
There is something grave in her look as John takes the phone.

Yeah, well I’m sure he was being

“all still meeting”?
CULVERTON SMITH
Yes. Me, you, Mr. Holmes. I’ve sent 
a car, it should be outside. Mr. 
Holmes gave me an address.
JOHN
Well he couldn’t have given you 
this one -
The doorbell rings before he can finish speaking.
John’s face: no! No!
He steps to the door opens it. A uniformed driver is already 
walking back down the path, towards a limo parked in the

MRS HUDSON
Sherlock told me. He’s not so 
difficult when you’ve got a gun on 
him.
JOHN
(Blazing at Sherlock)
How did you know?? How?? On Monday 
I decided to get a new therapist. 
Tuesday afternoon I chose her, 
Wednesday morning, I booked today’s 
session. This is Friday. Two weeks 
ago - two weeks before you were 
abducted at gunpoint and brought 
here against your will - over a 
week before I even thought about 
coming here - you knew exactly 
where you’d need to be picked up 
for lunch.
On Sherlock. Looks bemusedly round all the staring faces.
SHERLOCK
Really? I correctly anticipated the 
responses of people I know well to 
scenarios I devised. Can’t everyone  
do that?
MRS HUDSON
... how?
SHERLOCK
Except for the boot. The boot was 
mean.

Never mind how, he’s dying to tell 
us. I want to know why.

For answer, Sherlock extends his arm - pocked and marked with 
needle punctures.
SHERLOCK
Because Mrs Hudson is right. I’m 
burning up, I’m lost. I’m at the 
bottom of a pit, and I’m still 
falling, and I’m never going to 
climb out. But I need you to know, 
John, I need you to see, up here -
(He points to his head)
- still got it.
(Points at the laptop)
So when I say this is the most 
dangerous, most terrible human 
being I have ever encountered - 
when I tell you this is a monster 
who must be ended, please, remember 
where you’re standing. Because 
you’re standing exactly where I 
said you would be, two weeks ago.  
Still a genius, John. I’m a mess, 
I’m in hell, but God help me I’m 
still a genius and I am not wrong. 
Not about him!
He ends, pointing at the Culverton Smith’s face on the 
screen. The room silent for a moment. Sherlock so raw, so 
strung out, no one knows what to say for a moment.
JOHN
... what’s this got to do with me?
SHERLOCK
That creature, that rotting thing, 
is a living, breathing coagulation 
of human evil. And if the only 
thing I ever do in this world is 
drive him out of it, my life will 
not be wasted. But look at me. Look 
at me. I can’t do it. Not now. Not 
alone.
John, just looking at him, skeptical.
The room on tiptoe - what now?
John extends his hand -
- but when Sherlock goes to shake it, John turns his hand 
over and inspects the needle marks.
JOHN
Well, they’re real enough, I 
suppose.
SHERLOCK
Why would I be faking? 
JOHN
Because you’re a liar. You lie all

JOHN
Before I do anything, I need to 
know exactly what state you’re in.
SHERLOCK
You’re a doctor - examine me!
JOHN
I need a second opinion. 
SHERLOCK
Oh, John, calm down - when have you 
ever managed two opinions, you’d 
fall over!
JOHN
I need the one person who - unlike 
me - learned to see past all your 
bullshit a long time ago.
SHERLOCK
(Affronted)
Well who could that be? I’m sure 
I’d have noticed.
JOHN
The last person you’d ever think of 
- the very last. I want you
examined by Molly Hooper.
A beat - Sherlock looks pensive for a moment.

A ward full of children, waiting expectantly. Culverton Smith 
is among them. Nurses stand round the perimeter of the room, 
all their shining eyes turned on Sherlock.
John and Sherlock acknowledge a burst of applause.
One of the nurses calls out to Sherlock.
NURSE
Love your blog.
SHERLOCK
You’re welcome!
John’s face: seriously?
CULVERTON SMITH
Right, everyone, here he is. The 
Internet ‘Tec. You all know 
Sherlock Holmes.
Cheers from the kids.
SHERLOCK
Hello.
JOHN
Hi.
CULVERTON SMITH
And Dr. Watson of course.
Slightly desultory cheers. John forces a smile that could 
kill a small mammal.
CULVERTON SMITH
Mr. Holmes, I was wondering - we 
were all wondering, weren’t we? - 
maybe you could tell us about some 
of your cases.
SHERLOCK
No.
JOHN
Yes.
SHERLOCK
Yes. Absolutely, yes.

A few minutes later. Sherlock holding court, striding around 
in the middle of the ward - boring as hell.
John sits among the kids, listening.
SHERLOCK
The main feature of interest in the 
field of criminal investigation is 
not the sensationalist aspects  
pertaining to the crime itself, but 
the iron chain of reasoning, from 
cause to effect, that reveals, step 
by step, the solution and is the 
only truly remarkable aspect of the 
entire affair. I shall present to 
you all the facts and evidence that 
were available to me, and in this 
very room you will all attempt to 
solve the case of Blessington the 
poisoner.
JOHN
... I think you slightly gave away 
the ending.
SHERLOCK
There were five main suspects -
JOHN
Yeah, one of them called 
Blessington.
SHERLOCK
... okay, but it was more about how 
he did it.
JOHN
Poison?
SHERLOCK
... okay.
A slight laugh from the kids. As John glances at them, he 
sees Mary sitting among them, also suppressing a smile.
MARY
(Calling out)
He should be wearing the hat. The 
kids would love the hat.

Ten, yeah.
SHERLOCK
All of them guilty.

MARY
Honestly, he needs the hat. 
Everybody loves the hat.

SHERLOCK
John called this one - oh,  
something to do with murder at the 
zoo. 
JOHN
I called it Murder At The Zoo.
SHERLOCK
Or was it The Killer Orangutan?
A roar of laughter - but Sherlock is smiling impishly. It’s 
on purpose now.
Among them, John sees Mary, laughing, shaking her head. She 
looks at him.

SHERLOCK
Culverton.
CULVERTON SMITH
How do you catch a serial killer?
The room: the temperature lowering slightly. Nervous 
tittering from the kids, but it dies away fast.
Culverton, seemingly unaware of this: just sitting there, 
among them all. He’s picked up someone’s Barbie doll, and is 
absently stroking its hair
Sherlock, so serious now, his eyes fastened on Culverton.
SHERLOCK
The same way you catch any other 
killer.
CULVERTON SMITH
No. Most killers kill someone they 
know. You are looking for the 
murderer in a tiny social grouping.
Nurse Cornish, a little nervous, stepping forward.
NURSE CORNISH
Mr. Smith, I’m just wondering, 
maybe this isn’t a suitable subject 
for the children -
Culverton slides his gaze to look at her, mild, reptilian 
indifference. This silences her.
CULVERTON SMITH
Nurse Cornish, how long have you 
been with us now?
NURSE CORNISH
Seven years.
CULVERTON SMITH
Seven years. Okay.
And he just slides his gaze, like she’s ceased to exist.
CULVERTON SMITH
Serial killers choose their victims 
at random. Surely that makes it 
more difficult.
Sherlock holds his look for a moment. Then the thinnest of 
smiles.
SHERLOCK
Some of them advertise.

Culverton Smith, a little smile. Enjoying the fencing. Even 
enjoying, the suddenly frozen, tiptoed room.
CULVERTON SMITH
Do they really?
SHERLOCK
Serial killing is an expression of 
power, of ego. A signature in human 
destruction. Ultimately, for full 
satisfaction, it requires plain 
sight.
On John: the words “plain sight” seem to impact on him.
FLASHBACK: superfast replay of the entire scene in the back 
of the limo, Sherlock and John, Sherlock texting, Culverton 
appearing, Sherlock tossing him phone. Freeze frame as 
Culverton catches the phone, then superfast zoom on the phone 
in his hand.
JOHN
(A moment of realisation)
Shit!
Everyone looks to John. Nurse Cornish is particularly 
disapproving.
SHERLOCK
Apologies, Dr. Watson is thinking - 
one can generally hear it for 
miles.
JOHN
Sorry.
SHERLOCK
(To Culveron)
Additionally, serial killers are 
easily profiled.
(Deliberately goading)
They tend to be social outcasts, 
sexually atypical, generally of low 
IQ and attainment -
Still stoking the Barbie doll’s hair, Culverton Smith shakes 
his head - fastidious regret at Sherlock’s slowness.
CULVERTON SMITH
No. No, no. Those are the ones you 
know about. Those are the ones you 
caught. But hello, dummy - you only 
catch the dumb ones.
Sherlock, silenced by that. 
Nurses exchanges glances - what is going on? Too creepy.
CULVERTON SMITH
Now imagine. What if the Queen 
wanted to kill people.

What would happen then? All that 
money, all that power, a sweet 
little government, dancing 
attendance. A whole country to keep 
you warm and fat.
And pop! He’s pulled the Barbie’s head off. John, looking 
round. The nurses, their hands clasped, looking at the floor 
because they don’t know where to look ... not the first time 
he’s talked creepily.
CULVERTON SMITH
(Looking round the kids)
Do we all like the Queen? I bet 
she’d like you lot.
JOHN
It’s all right, everyone. I can 
personally assure you that Sherlock 
Holmes is not going to arrest the 
Queen.
CULVERTON SMITH
Well of course not. Not her 
majesty. Money, power, fame - some 
things make you untouchable. God 
save the Queen - she could build 
her own slaughterhouse and we’d all 
pay for entrance.
On John, the impact of that. His eyes raise to:
Another plaque on the wall: The Culverton Smith Wing.
JOHN
No one’s untouchable.
CULVERTON SMITH
No one?
John looks at him. Such disdain in his eyes. He gets it now, 
gets what his man is.
JOHN
Plain sight.
CULVERTON SMITH
I’m sorry?
JOHN
Serial.
He reaches for Culverton’s phone, which is sitting on the 
table next to him. Holds it up Culverton, showing him the 
back.

Culverton, just smiling up at him.
Suddenly the switch is thrown, Culverton gives a big, genial 
laugh.
CULVERTON SMITH
Oh, look at you all, taking me 
seriously! The Queen! If the Queen 
was a serial killer, I’d be the 
first person she’d tell - we have 
that kind of friendship.
Suddenly everyone is laughing - not just obedience, relief. 
He’s stopped his creepy mucking about now.
CULVERTON SMITH
Let’s all have a big round of 
applause for Sherlock Holmes and 
Dr. Watson!
He’s on his feet, Abigail has gratefully scampered away. And 
he’s on his feet now, pounding his hands together, 
applauding. That jumble-tooth grin, those gleaming eyes, 
boring into Sherlock.
Everyone applauding.
And Sherlock and John staring coldly back...

But around the table, just as at the start are drip feeds 
mounted on mobile stands, behind several of chairs. The 
little control panels are sitting on the table.
Sherlock is examining the dripfeeds and controls as John and 
Culverton enter.
SHERLOCK
So you’ve had another of your 
meetings.
CULVERTON SMITH
Just a top-up. Confession is good 
for the soul - provided there’s a 
take-back.
JOHN
What’s TD 12?
SHERLOCK
A memory inhibitor. 
CULVERTON SMITH
Bliss.
JOHN
Bliss?
CULVERTON SMITH
Opt-in ignorance. It makes the 
world go round. 
SHERLOCK
Does anyone ever opt to remember.
CULVERTON SMITH
Some people take out the drip, yes. 
Some of the people have the same 
... urges. We’re wasting time.
He starts to lead the way from the room.
SHERLOCK
Indeed. You have, I estimate, 
twenty minutes.
CULVERTON SMITH
I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK
I sent a text from your phone, 
remember? It was read almost 
immediately. Factoring in a degree 
of shock, an emotional decision, 
and a journey time based on the 
associated address, I’d say your 
life, as you know it, has twenty 
minutes left to run. Well,

A long low corridor - we’re deep beneath the hospital wall. 
Rough concrete walls, the feeling of pressure. (We need to

A clanking doors of a big old lift are rolling open. 
Culverton, Sherlock and John emerge.
As they walk along:
CULVERTON SMITH
Speaking of serial killers, do you 
know who’s my favourite?
SHERLOCK
Other than yourself?
CULVERTON SMITH
H. H. Holmes. Relative of yours?

How long you been here now, Saheed?
SAHEED
Four years.
CULVERTON SMITH
Four years, eh? That’s long, isn’t 
it, four?
He lets that just hang there - smiling, unblinking.
A beat, then:
SAHEED
Okay, everyone.
He pulls the sheet over the body, they all file out.
SAHEED
Five minutes?
CULVERTON SMITH
Come back in ten. 
Saheed gives a humiliated little nod, starts heading to the 
door.
CULVERTON SMITH
And Saheed?
Saheed turns at the door.
CULVERTON SMITH
This time, knock.
Saheed nods, withdraws, closing the door.
John, looking appalled Culverton Smith.

Sherlock has pulled open one of the drawers, looks at the 
dead body inside.
SHERLOCK
Tough crowd.
Culverton Smith pulls back the sheet from the slab. A Woman, 
lying there.
CULVERTON SMITH
Oh, I don’t know. I’ve always found 
them quite ... pliable.
He reaches out, starts moving the dead woman’s head from side 
to side. Rocking it gently.
JOHN
Don’t do that.
CULVERTON SMITH
She’s fine. She’s dead. Now H. H. 
Holmes loved dead people - he mass 
produced them. 
SHERLOCK
(To John)
Serial killer. Active during the 
Chicago Fair. 
CULVERTON SMITH
Do you know what he did? He built a 
hotel. A special hotel, just to 
kill people. 
Now Culverton starts moving the dead woman’s jaw, making he 
speak like a ventriloquist dummy.
CULVERTON SMITH
A hanging room, a gas chamber, a 
specially adapted furnace. Like 
Sweeney Todd, without the pies. 
Stupid. So stupid.
He throws the sheet back over the body.
JOHN
Stupid?
CULVERTON SMITH
Well all that effort! You don’t 
build a beach to hide a pebble. You 
just go find a beach. If you want 
to hide a murder - if you want to 
hide lots and lots of murders ... 
find a hospital.

JOHN
The way you’re talking -
CULVERTON SMITH
Sorry, yes - you mean, am I serial 
killer? Or am I just messing with 
your funny little head? I do like 
to mess with people, and yes, I’m a 
little creepy - it’s my USP, it’s 
how I sell breakfast cereal - but 
am I really what he says I am? Is 
that what you’re asking?
JOHN
... yes.
CULVERTON SMITH
Well can I ask you this. Are you 
really a doctor?
JOHN
Of course I am.
CULVERTON SMITH
A medical doctor. Not just feet or 
media studies, or something.
JOHN
I’m a doctor.
A beat - then the mood changes. Culverton’s genial smile 
drops just a fraction, and somehow the room freezes over.
CULVERTON SMITH
Then are you serious?
On John, this impacts. What? He looks to Sherlock -
- who seems to be drifting away from the conversation, 
seemingly distracted.
CULVERTON SMITH
No, really are you? Are you 
actually serious?
John, floundering for a moment, not sure how to reply. 
CULVERTON SMITH
I’ve played along with this joke, 
but isn’t funny any more. Look at 
him. Go, on, actually look at him, 
Doctor Watson.
John looks to Sherlock. He’s had the other end of the room. 
Sickly and pale in the harsh light. Somehow reduced.

Holmes is off his head on drugs.
John: a flicker of doubt. 
Sherlock, silent.
Culverton, now rounding on Sherlock. Now walking up to him.
CULVERTON SMITH
Delusional paranoia about a 
prominent public figure. That’s not 
special. That’s not even new. 
Sherlock just staring at him. Not a flicker.
CULVERTON SMITH
Tell your faithful little friend 
how you’ve been wasting his time, 
because you’re too high to know 
what’s real any more.
Sherlock, holds Culverton’s look for a moment (we don’t note 
it, but distantly we hear the clank of the lift arriving.) 
Then Sherlock looks to John. 
SHERLOCK
My apologies. I’m afraid I 
miscalculated.
On John: what??
SHERLOCK
(Looks to his watch)
I forgot to factor in traffic - 19 
and a half minutes.
He puts a hand to his ear - exaggerated listening.
Distantly we hear lift doors clanking open.
Sherlock consults his watch.
SHERLOCK
The footsteps you are about to hear 
will be familiar to you - not 
least, because there will be three 
impacts, rather than two. The 
third, of course, is the end of a

And oh my God!
First we see Sherlock’s face -
- as it falls into confusion and incomprehension.
The woman standing in the doorway isn’t the woman we saw at 
Baker Street. In fact, she’s the jollier, more colourfully 
dressed we saw in the Board Room as the top the show - 
unchanged, exactly as she was then.
Sherlock: what??
FAITH
Dad? What’s happening, what was 
that text? Are you having one of 
your jokes?
(Looks to Sherlock)
Who are you?
Close on Faith. This is a completely different woman.
Sherlock Vision: a whirling moment of revelations. Close on 
Faith’s face - now zip panning to the other Faith, the one 
that visited Baker Street. Different face, different woman. 
Now both Faiths, impossibly standing together. Completely 
different people, always were.
SHERLOCK
Who the hell are you?
CULVERTON SMITH
It’s Sherlock Holmes - surely you 
recognise him?
Culverton, relaxed now, everything back under control, his 
hands clasped behind him (does he have the scalpel?)
Faith looks to Sherlock
FAITH
Oh my God, Sherlock Holmes - I love 
your blog. 
On Sherlock - lost, more completely thrown than we’ve ever

Behind his back, look behind his 
back -
But Culverton has brought his hands out from behind him - 
nothing in his hands.
SHERLOCK
I saw you take a scalpel! I saw 
you!
He’s now pointing accusingly at Culverton -
- but everyone is staring at him. Why?
Slowly Sherlock realises. Gripped in his pointing hand, 
shaking ... is a scalpel.
He looks at it, bemused, an impossible thing.
JOHN
... Sherlock. You want to put that 
down.
Sherlock staring at Culverton, who is staring, appalled back.
FAITH
Oh my God. Oh my God!
SHERLOCK
Stop laughing at me.
There’s something crazed in his face now.
CULVERTON SMITH
I’m not laughing.
JOHN
He’s not laughing, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
Stop laughing at me!
And now, madly, he’s lunging at Culverton, slashing wildly 
with the scalpel.

But it was fun.
LESTRADE
Yeah. I suppose it was.
A tap at the door, a policewoman, entering - she is holding 
an opened laptop.
POLICEWOMAN

She’s setting the laptop down on the table, John and Lestrade 
moving to see.
On the laptop - a news programme, footage of the hospital we 
saw before.

Harold Chorely, reporting from 
Medford, where the attack happened 
earlier today. At a press

no interest in bringing charges.
The picture changes to Culverton addressing a ring of 
microphones and cameras.
CULVERTON SMITH
(On TV)
I’m a fan, I’m a big fan of 
Sherlock Holmes. I don’t know what 
happened today, but he’s been under

But I can promise you this. He’s
going to get the best of care.

Now a couple of orderlies - drawn by the noise - are pulling 
John off Sherlock.
Sherlock, curled on the floor, arms wrapped round his head, 
whimpering.
CULVERTON SMITH
Thankyou, Dr. Watson. But I don’t 
think he’s a danger any more. Leave 
him be.
John, struggling to calm himself, the orderlies releasing.
Then, a voice from the floor.
SHERLOCK
No, it’s okay.
Sherlock more defeated and despairing than we’ve ever seen 
him, is looking up at John from the floor.
SHERLOCK

Equipment beeps around him. He looks white and shrunken and 
close to death.
JOHN
Hi.
NURSE CORNISH
Just in to say hello?
She bustles around the equipment.
John, looking sadly at his old friend.
JOHN
No. Goodbye.
NURSE CORNISH
Oh, I’m sure he’ll pull through. 
He’s made a terrible mess of 
himself but he’s awfully strong. 
Must look on the bright side.
John, barely listening, steps forward, places something next

MYCROFT
Sherlock is a security concern. The 
fact that I’m his brother changes 
nothing, I told you before.
On John as a pang of memory hits him - a faint frown.
JOHN
Yeah. Yeah, you did -
Mary passes behind John, quickly whispering in his ear.
MARY
Ask him!
MYCROFT
Why fixate on Culverton Smith? He’s 
had his obsessions before, of 
course, but this goes a bit further 
than setting a mantrap for Father 
Christmas -
MARY
Do it, ask him.
MYCROFT
Spending all night talking to an 
imaginary woman, who isn’t even 
there -
MARY
Shut up, you.
One of the Spooks walks past, sets some books down on the 
table. Something flutters from the table, lands on the floor.
Closer - it’s the Faith’s note, the one from which Sherlock 
made all the deductions. Really, physically there.
JOHN
Mycroft - last time, when we were

He’s lying.

You’re lying.

Sherlock isn’t your only brother. 
There’s another one, isn’t there?

No.

Just the faintest flicker on Mycroft’s face -
- and he’s saved by the tumultuous arrival of Mrs Hudson.
MRS HUDSON
Mycroft Holmes, what are these 
dreadful people doing in my house -
MYCROFT
Mrs Hudson, I apologise for the 
interruption. As you know, my 
brother has embarked on a programme 
of self-destruction remarkable even 
by his standards, and I am 
endeavoring to find out what 
triggered it.
MRS HUDSON

MYCROFT
Mrs Hudson?
MRS HUDSON
He thinks you’re clever, poor old 
Sherlock - always going about you. 
(Pats John’s arm, 
comforting)
I mean, he knows you’re an idiot, 
but that’s okay, because you’re a 
lovely doctor.
(To Mycroft)
But he’s got no idea what an idiot 
you are.
MYCROFT
Is this merely stream-of-
consciousness abuse or are you 
attempting to make a point.
MRS HUDSON 
You want to know what’s bothering 
Sherlock, easiest thing in the 
world. Anyone can do it.
MYCROFT
I know his thought processes better 
than any other human being, so 
please try to understand -
MRS HUDSON
Oh, he’s not about thinking, not 
Sherlock -

Culverton, Sherlock -

The doors are flying open, John Watson bursting through.
Sees what’s going on in an instant, throws himself at 
Culverton with an animal roar.
Slamming him insanely hard against wall.
Sherlock choking, spluttering.
The policeman from outside, going straight to him.
POLICEMAN
Mr. Holmes, you okay?

JOHN
What were you doing to him, what 
were you doing?
CULVERTON SMITH
He was in distress, I was helping 
him.
JOHN
(To Policeman)
Restrain him, now, do it!
CULVERTON SMITH
I was trying to help!
The Policeman now firmly moving Culverton away from John.
JOHN
Sherlock, what was he doing to you.
Sherlock, recovering, waves vaguely at the drip feed.
SHERLOCK
Overdosing me.
JOHN
(Moving to the dripfee)
On what? 
SHERLOCK
Saline.
JOHN
Saline! Saline?
SHERLOCK
Yes, saline.
JOHN
What do you mean, saline?
SHERLOCK
Well, obviously I got Nurse Cornish 
to switch the bags. She’s a big 
fan, you know. Loves my blog.
John staring at him: what? What??
JOHN
... You’re okay.
SHERLOCK
Of course I’m not okay. 
Malnutrition, double kidney failure 
and frankly I’ve been off my tits 
for weeks - what kind of a doctor 
are you?
(Looks to Culverton)
Got my confession, though, didn’t 
I?

CULVERTON SMITH
I don’t recall any confession. What

SHERLOCK
You can listen later.
CULVERTON SMITH
There’s no confession to listen to. 
And Mr. Holmes, if it’s relevant to 
add - we found three potential 
recording devices inside your coat. 
They were all removed. Sorry.
SHERLOCK
Must have been very comforting. 
Finding three. People always give 
up after three.
On John: twigging that Sherlock has some other plan. 
JOHN
What? What is it, what?
CULVERTON SMITH
All of your possessions were 
searched.
Sherlock’s eyes are on John. Almost an apologetic look - and 
John gets it.
JOHN
You cock.
SHERLOCK
Yes.
JOHN
Utter, utter cock.
SHERLOCK
Heard you the first time.
JOHN
How does it open?
SHERLOCK
Twist the top.
John walks round the bed to -
- his old walking stick. Picks it up, twists the hand off. A 
length of wire revealed inside, and some mechanism.
JOHN
Predictable, am I?
SHERLOCK
No.

I’m a cock.

Policewoman across the table.
They all look harrowed - except:
CULVERTON SMITH
It’s funny. I never realised 
confessing would be so ... 
enjoyable. I should have done it 
sooner.
Lestrade looks at him, sick to his stomach.
LESTRADE
We’ll carry on tomorrow.
CULVERTON SMITH
We can carry on now, I’m not tired. 
There’s loads more.
LESTRADE
Tomorrow.
CULVERTON SMITH
You know, I am going to be so 
famous now.
LESTRADE
You’re already famous.
CULVERTON SMITH
Yes. But with this, I think can 
break America.
And he gives the biggest, happiest smile. Those teeth.

Sherlock and John in their accustomed chairs. Sherlock looks 
a bit better, but still huddled and think, wrapped in his 
dressing gown.
SHERLOCK
Trouble is, I couldn’t remember 
what they were. And course, I 
hadn’t really anticipated that I’d 
hallucinated meeting his daughter - 
MARY
(Behind the Sherlock’s 
chair)
Basically, he trashed himself on 
drugs, so you’d help him - so you’d 
have something to do, something 
doctory. Get it now?
SHERLOCK
Still a bit confused about the 
daughter ... did seem very real. 
And she managed to give me 
information I couldn’t have 
acquired otherwise.
JOHN
But she wasn’t ever here.
SHERLOCK
Interesting, isn’t it? I have 
theorised before that if one was 
able to attenuate to every 
available data stream in the world 
simultaneously, it would be 
possible to anticipate and deduce 
almost anything.
JOHN
So you dreamed up a magic woman to 
tell you things you didn’t know?
MARY
Sounds right to me. Possibly I’m 
biased.
SHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 2 - GREEN AMENDMENTS 10.06.16

SHERLOCK
Perhaps the drugs opened certain 
doors in my head. I’m intrigued
JOHN
I know. Which is why we’re all 
taking it in turns, keeping you off 
the sweeties.
SHERLOCK
I thought we were just hanging out.
A beat on John - a tight smile, a certain lack of answering 
warmth.
JOHN
Molly will be here in twenty 
minutes.
SHERLOCK
I do think I can last twenty 
minutes without supervision.
JOHN
Well if you’re sure.
John is already setting down his tea. 
MARY
Christ, John, stay, talk. 
On Sherlock: slightly startled that he’s taking him up on 
that.
John registers Sherlock’s surprise.
JOHN
Sorry, just, you know, Rosie...
SHERLOCK
Of course, Rosie.
MARY
Go and solve a crime together. Make 
him wear the hat.
JOHN
You’ll be fine for twenty minutes.
SHERLOCK
Yes, yes. Stupid, I wasn’t thinking 
about Rosie. 
JOHN
No problem.
SHERLOCK
I should come and see her soon.
JOHN
Yes.

The “yes” is very flat. Like John just won’t engage with the 
idea. 
MARY
You know, he should wear the hat as 
a special tribute to me. I’m dead, 
I’d really appreciate it.
John is heading for the door.
Sherlock, clearly desperate to engage, can’t seem to get a 
conversation started.
SHERLOCK
By the way, that recording may be 
inadmissable.
JOHN
Sorry, what?
SHERLOCK
It was technically entrapment, so 
it may get kicked out as evidence. 
Not that it matters. Apparently he 
can’t stop confessing.
A smile from Sherlock. No answering smile from John.
JOHN
Well, good. That’s good.
SHERLOCK
Yeah.
A pained silence between them. Talking was once so easy. Now 
they can hardly think of anything to say.
SHERLOCK
... are you okay?
JOHN
No. I’m not okay, I’m never going 
to be okay. I think we probably 
just have to accept that. It is 
what it is. And what it is, is 
shit.
Sherlock, defeated. A little nod.
John turns to the door. 
MARY
John, do better.

You didn’t kill Mary. Mary died

one made her do it. No one could 
ever make her do anything. But the 
point is you did not kill her.
SHERLOCK
In saving my life, she conferred a 
value on it. It is a currency I do 
not know how to spend.
JOHN
(A beat; shrugs)
It is what it is.
(Turns to door)
I’m tomorrow six till ten. See you 
then.
SHERLOCK
Looking forward to it.
JOHN
Yes.
He’s opening the door to leave, when something happens. A 
noise. From Sherlock’s phone, lying on the table. A text 
alert noise in the form of an orgasmic gasp.
John freezes in astonishment.
Sherlock freezes in embarrassment, a guilty school boy.
And Mary is suddenly next to John, amazed.
MARY
Oh, that noise. That’s a text alert 
noise - that’s -
JOHN
What was that?
Sherlock now seems to be avoiding his gaze.
SHERLOCK
What was what?
MARY
That’s the text alert of Irene 
Adler. The scary, mad one right?
JOHN
That noise.
SHERLOCK
What noise?
MARY
But she’s dead. Oh, but I bet she 
isn’t dead, I bet he saved her.

For God sake, the posh boy in love

his chair, looks up at him, innocently - so determined to 
keep his secret.
SHERLOCK
John?
JOHN
... I’m going to make a deduction.
SHERLOCK
Okay. That’s good.
JOHN
And if my deduction is right, 
you’re going to be honest, and tell 
me, okay?
SHERLOCK
Okay. Though I should mention it is 
possible for any given text alert 
to become randomly attached to an 
entirely different -
JOHN
Happy Birthday.
SHERLOCK
... Thank you, John, that’s very 
kind.
Sherlock now avoiding John’s gaze - like a teenager quizzed 
by his parents about his girlfriend.
JOHN
Never knew when your birthday was.
SHERLOCK
Well now you do.
John gives up, turns to go. Can’t. Turns back.
JOHN

nights of passion in High Wycombe?
SHERLOCK
Oh for God’s sake, I don’t text her 
back!
And then John lets rip, yelling.
JOHN
Why the hell not, you bloody 
moron!!
Sherlock startled.
JOHN
She’s out there, and she likes you, 
and she’s alive and do you have the 
first idea how you lucky you are?? 
I mean, she’s a lunatic, she’s a 
criminal, she’s insanely dangerous, 
trust you to fall for a sociopath -
MARY
(Walking behind him)
Married an assassin.
JOHN
- but she’s ... you know.
SHERLOCK
What?
JOHN
Just ... text her back.
SHERLOCK
Why?
JOHN
Because High Wycombe is better than 
you are currently equipped to 
understand.
SHERLOCK
... I once caught a triple poisoner 
in High Wycombe.
JOHN
Only the beginning, mate.
SHERLOCK
I think I have explained to you 
already, that romantic 
entanglement, while fulfilling for 
other people -

Phone her, text her, do something, 
while there’s still a chance. 
Because the chance doesn’t last 
forever. Trust me, Sherlock, it 
goes before you know it!
(Voice breaking now)
Before you bloody know it.
On Sherlock: not speaking, cautious, aware that John isn’t 
talking about Irene any more, he’s talking about Mary.
JOHN
She was wrong about me.
SHERLOCK
... how so?
John looks over, sees Mary staring at him, so solemn.
JOHN
She thought if you put yourself in 
harm’s way, I’d rescue you, or 
something. But I didn’t. Not till 
she told me to. 
(To Sherlock)
That’s how it works. That’s what 
you’re missing. She taught me how 
to be the man she already thought I 
was. Get yourself a piece of that.
SHERLOCK
Forgive me, but I think you do 
yourself a disservice. I have known 
many people, but made few friends, 
and I can safely say -
JOHN
I cheated on her.
This silences Sherlock. He just stares.
JOHN
What? No clever come-back?
(Directly to Mary)
I cheated on you, Mary.
(NB This sequence blocked and played so that Sherlock can 
assume that John is talking to Mary in the abstract, rather 
than as someone physically in front of him.)

There was a woman. On the bus. I

girl smiled at me. That’s all it 
took. A smile. 
Mary: saying nothing.
Sherlock: saying nothing.
JOHN
We texted. Constantly. You want to 
know when? Every time you went out 
the room, that’s when. When you 
were feeding our child, or stopping 
her crying, that’s when. 
Mary: silence.
Sherlock: silence.
JOHN
That’s all it was. Just texting. 
But I wanted more. And you know 
what. I still do! I’m not who you 
thought I was. Not that guy, never 
could be. But that’s the point. 
That’s the whole point.
(Holds her look for a 
moment: again, prepared)
Who you thought I was, is the man I 
want to be.
Mary just holds his look for a long moment. And then:
MARY
Well, then, John Watson - get the 
hell on with it.
He smiles looks away for a moment -
- and when he looks back, Mary is gone. And he knows, in that 
moment, he won’t see her again. The conversation is over.
On John. Bereft, starting to cry. Really sobbing now, the 
floodgates open.
Sherlock: not sure what to do for a moment. Then he heaves 
himself out of his chair, goes to John, and hugs him.

SHERLOCK
So Molly will want to meet us at

JOHN
Molly will be here twice as fast if 
there’s cake. It’s your birthday - 
cake is obligatory
SHERLOCK
Well, I suppose a sugar high will 
be some sort of substitute.
JOHN
Behave.
SHERLOCK
Right then!
(Hesitates)
You know ... not my place to say 
... but it was only texting. People 
text. Even I text.
(Holds up phone)
Her, I mean. Woman. I try not to. 
Bad idea. But, you know sometimes, 
well ...
(Shrugs, a little 
embarrassed)
It’s not a pleasant thought, John, 
but I have this terrible feeling, 
from time to time, that we might 
all just be human.
On John: just a little moved. That confession was so kindly 
meant.
JOHN
Even you?

No. Even you.

SHERLOCK
I’m Sherlock Holmes. I wear the 
damn hat.
And out the door he strides. John, bemused for a moment.
Looks around - a figure seems to flick out of sight. Mary?
