EXT. COURT STEPS. NIGHT.

Text: EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO.
A case is over, Lestrade is storming down the steps, in a 
fury. Donovan following him
LESTRADE
They just walked out of there ... !
DONOVAN
Yeah, I know, I was sort of sitting  
next to you.
LESTRADE
The whole Waters family. They just 
walked right out of there.
DONOVAN
Again, I was in the room, I was 
there when it happened.
LESTRADE
How can they always do that!
DONOVAN
They’re good.
LESTRADE
They’re greedy, they’ll do it 
again, and next time we’re going to 
catch them in the act.
He storms off down the steps. 
DONOVAN
(Starting to follow)
How?
FADE TO BLACK:
INT. LESTRADE’S CAR. NIGHT.

AA1
Text: ONE YEAR AGO.
Sally waiting in the passenger seat, lit by the flashing blue 
lights of squad cars parked near-by - a hugely pissed off 
Lestrade, slams into the car.
DONOVAN
No good?
LESTRADE
They always know we’re coming. How 
do they always know??

DONOVAN
They’re good. They work at it.
LESTRADE
And they’re never going to stop!
She puts a comforting hand on his arm.
DONOVAN
Neither are we.

INT. COURT STEPS - DAY

Tiny fast scene - Lestrade storming down the steps, face like 
thunder again. Donovan following.

Text: FOUR MONTHS AGO.
Lestrade’s car, parked a short distance from the court. An 
enraged Lestrade kicking savagely at the one of his car 
wheels, taking out his frustration. Donovan watches 
sympathetically, as do several police officers - she gently 
intervenes.
DONOVAN
Greg ....
LESTRADE
(Rounds on her)
In the act! Only way we’re going to 
do it! In. The. Act!
FADE TO BLACK:
EXT/INT. BANK. DAY

Text: Today.
ECU - a hideous face. Green flesh, blank expression -
FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER!
Pull out to reveal the Monster is holding a sawn-off shotgun. 
It’s an armed bank job -- with Hallowe’en masks.

The massive vault door is open and DRACULA is loading money 
onto a cart. 
Another of the robbers - THE MUMMY, sits at a laptop, tapping 
away.
Close on the alarm. Totally silent. 
CUT TO:
EXT. BANK. DAY.

In an unmarked car, LESTRADE and DONOVAN. She has an open 
laptop on her knee. 
LESTRADE
They’re still blocking it?
DONOVAN
Yeah. Very efficiently hacked. They 
must be bloody pleased with 
themselves. 
LESTRADE
Must be. 
They share a smile. 
CUT TO:
INT. BANK. DAY

The cart is now groaning under the weight of cash, safety

A phalanx of armed POLICE in bullet-proof vests. LESTRADE and 
DONOVAN are at their head. 
LESTRADE
Right then. 
He ushers Donovan ahead.
DONOVAN
No, no, no. You’ve got to make the 
arrest. This one’s yours, boss. 
LESTRADE
... never called me boss before.

DONOVAN
Well look what happens when you’re 
good!
Lestrade can’t help feeling chuffed.
LESTRADE
You know how most days aren’t good 
days. This is a good day.
DONOVAN
Not for the Waters family.
And then his phone rings in his pocket. A very distinctive 
ring. He’s about to answer, but ignores it. 
LESTRADE
Come on. 
They start to move forward.
DONOVAN
Ten men on the roof, all exits 
covered. Bank’s closed so no 
hostages worry about  - 
The phone rings again angrily. Donovan sighs.
LESTRADE
Sorry. Go on. 
DONOVAN
We’ve got the tunnel entrance 
covered and Davies, Willow and 
Christie --
Ring, ring. 
- are heading up armed response in
Mafeking Road -
LESTRADE
Sorry. Better get this. 
DONOVAN
It’s him, isn’t it?
Lestrade reaches apologetically for his phone - glances at 
the display.
Text on screen.
HELP. BAKER STREET. NOW. 
HELP ME PLEASE!
LESTRADE
I...I have to go.

DONOVAN

LESTRADE
You make the arrest. 
DONOVAN
No way!
LESTRADE
Sorry. You’ll be fine. I’m cool 
with it. 
DONOVAN
Gregson’ll get all the credit if 
you go now. You know he will. 
A beat of regret from Lestrade. 
LESTRADE
Doesn’t matter. I’ve got to go. 
He dashes back to his car. 
CUT TO:
INT. STREET. DAY

LESTRADE in his car, pedal to the metal. And the car speeds

And he’s on the phone. 
LESTRADE

LESTRADE bursts through the door of 221B. He’s moved heaven 
and earth to get here - doused in sweat, panting.
SHERLOCK at his laptop, tapping away. Without a care in the 
world. Either side of him, the windows are being lit by the 
flashing blue lights of police cars
Doesn’t even look up.
LESTRADE
What’s going on?
SHERLOCK
This is hard.

LESTRADE
What?
SHERLOCK
Really hard. Hardest thing I’ve 
ever done.
He holds up a book: ‘HOW TO WRITE AN UNFORGETTABLE BEST MAN 
SPEECH.’
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Do you know any funny stories about 
John? 
LESTRADE
What???
SHERLOCK
I need anecdotes. 
Lestrade looks like he’s going to have a stroke.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Didn’t go to any trouble, did you?
And the curtains billow - 
The deafening sound of a helicopter landing in Baker Street -

Baker Street in the early morning (from Scandal?)
A violin is playing - a sad, beautiful waltz.

3AA
3AA
Mrs. Hudson ascending the stairs carrying a tray with a pot 
of tea and some cups. The violin, louder now -
- but when she steps through the door, it’s an iPhone
attached to a speaker that is playing.
And there’s Sherlock Holmes. Dancing. Sort of. His hands 
behind his back, he’s moving in a solemn, formal dance around 
the flat - a waltz in fact. His face is serious, he’s 
concentrating.
Mrs. Hudson just stares.

SHERLOCK
Please shut up, Mrs. Hudson.
MRS. HUDSON
I didn’t say a word.
SHERLOCK
You were formulating a question - 
it’s physically painful to watch 
you think.
He steps over to the iPod, switches it off. Now makes a note 
on a sheet of manuscript - like he’s composing.
MRS. HUDSON
I thought it was you playing.
SHERLOCK
It is me. I’m composing.
MRS. HUDSON
You were dancing.
SHERLOCK
No. I was road testing.
MRS. HUDSON
You were what?
SHERLOCK
Why are you here?
MRS. HUDSON
I’m bringing you your morning tea. 
You’re not usually awake.
SHERLOCK
You bring me tea in the mornings?
MRS. HUDSON
Where did you think it came from?
SHERLOCK
I don’t know. I thought it just 
sort of happened.
MRS. HUDSON
Your mother has a lot to answer 
for.
SHERLOCK
I agree. I have a list. Mycroft has 
a file.
Mrs. Hudson, now settling down for a chat.
MRS. HUDSON
So. It’s the big day then.

SHERLOCK
What big day?
MRS. HUDSON
The wedding! John and Mary, getting 
married!
SHERLOCK
A couple, who currently live 
together, are about to attend  
church, have a party and a short 
holiday, and then carry on living 
together. What’s big about that?
MRS. HUDSON
It changes people, marriage. 
SHERLOCK
No it doesn’t.
MRS. HUDSON
You wouldn’t understand, you’ve 
always been alone.
SHERLOCK
Your husband was executed for 
double murder, you’re hardly an 
advert for companionship.
MRS. HUDSON
Marriage changes you as a person in 
ways you can’t imagine.
SHERLOCK
As does lethal injection.
MRS. HUDSON
My best friend, Margaret - she was 
my chief bridesmaid. We were going 
to be best friends forever, we 
always said so. But I hardly ever 
saw her after that.
SHERLOCK
(Examining the tea tray)
Aren’t there usually biscuits?
MRS. HUDSON
I’ve run out.
SHERLOCK
Have the shops run out too?
MRS. HUDSON
She cried the whole day. Kept 
saying it was the end of an era.

Sherlock, losing patience, has opened the door for her to 
leave.
SHERLOCK
The shop on the corner should be 
open, I think. 
MRS. HUDSON
She was right I suppose. I remember 
she left early. Who leaves a 
wedding early, it was so sad.
SHERLOCK
Anyway. You’ve got things to do...
MRS. HUDSON
I don’t, really, I’ve got plenty of 
time to get ready -
SHERLOCK
Biscuits!
She starts heading out.
MRS. HUDSON
I really am going to have a word 
with your mother.
SHERLOCK
You can if you like, she 
understands very little.
He closes the door behind her. Looks thoughtful for a moment. 
Goes to his page of manuscript, makes a note.
Then goes to where his morning suit is hanging, waiting for 
him.
Seems to brace himself.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Well then! Into battle!
He starts to take off his dressing gown ....
WE NOW CUT TO MAJOR SHOLTO PUTTING ON HIS MILITARY 
UNIFORM....
INT. SHOLTO’S HOTEL ROOM. DAY.
3A
3A 
CLOSE on a smart soldier’s uniform. It’s being buttoned 
slowly but efficiently - by one hand. 
We enjoy the detail. The braiding. The shiny boots. And the 
dull bronze of a Victoria Cross, pinned to the soldier’s 
chest.

Pull back to reveal the reflection of a tall, distinguished 
looking man in his 50s - JAMES SHOLTO. He has a vivid scar 
right down his face and his left arm hangs by his side - 
stiff and useless. 
He looks at himself in the mirror but his face is impassive. 
EXT. CHURCH. DAY

A country churchyard - 
TIGHT IN on the church doors.
We hear the organ start up - MENDELSSON’S ‘Wedding March’. 
The ceremony ending.
The doors fly open - the organ swells - and the BRIDE and 
GROOM emerge, newly married. JOHN and MARY side by side, 
beaming with joy and pride. Her in an elegant ivory gown. Him 
in full uniform.
They emerge from church, framed in the doorway. 
And SHERLOCK steps into the shot with them.
JOHN and MARY seem completely un-phased by his intrusion. 
A PHOTOGRAPHER is waiting, just out of shot.
PHOTOGRAPHER
OK, stop there. I want to get this 
shot. The newly weds.
They stop and pose. The PHOTOGRAPHER manhandling them into 
place.
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
Which is the groom?
JOHN
(mild)
Sherlock. You’ll need to move.
SHERLOCK
Oh. Ok. 
And he steps out of the picture.
Click.
A still of JOHN and MARY.

BRIDE and GROOM. BEST MAN and BRIDESMAID. 
HOLD on this quartet whilst they wait for the PHOTOGRAPHER to 
set up the shot.
The Chief Bridesmaid, JANINE (20s) smiles nervously at 
SHERLOCK. This is her first chance to say ‘Hello’ to him. And 
he is properly famous after all.
JANINE
You’re Sherlock. Hi. Janine. 
SHERLOCK
(Polite smile)
Hello.
JANINE
The famous Mr. Holmes - very 
pleased to meet you. But no sex, 
okay?
SHERLOCK
... I’m sorry?
JANINE
Don’t look so scared, joking. 
Bridesmaid, best Man, it’s a bit 
traditional
SHERLOCK
Is it?
JANINE
But not obligatory.
SHERLOCK
If that’s the sort of thing you’re 
looking for, best bet would be the 
man in beige. Recently divorced 
doctor with a ginger cat, a barn 
conversion, and a history of 
erectile disfunction.
(A beat)
Reviewing that information, 
possibly not your best bet.

JANINE
Yeah, maybe not.
SHERLOCK
Sorry, there was one more deduction 
than I was really expecting.
Janine is looking at him thoughtfully - now links arms with 
him.
JANINE
Mr. Holmes, you are going to be 
incredibly useful.
Click!
Photograph is taken of them, linked arms, her mischievous, 
him bemused.

The receiving line. 
MARY, JOHN, SHERLOCK, a few key relatives - all ready to 
greet the guests. Lots of grip and grin.
First in the queue to say ‘Hello’ to them is a young man - 
DAVID. Personable, attractive, 30s. But looking oddly 
reticent.

She goes to kiss him. He all but recoils, pulling back. 
Shakes her hand
DAVID
(Very formal)
Congratulations, Mary. You 
look...very nice. 
MARY
(puzzled)
Thanks. 
DAVID
(Shakes John’s hand)
Congratulations, John. You’re a 
lucky man.
JOHN
(Also puzzled)
Cheers.
MARY
Um. David. This is Sherlock. 
Sherlock smiles. David’s face falls. 
DAVID
We’ve met.

FLASHBACK.
SHERLOCK’s in his chair, fingers steepled. DAVID sits 
opposite.
DAVID
What exactly are my duties? As an 
usher.
SHERLOCK
Can we talk about Mary first? 
DAVID
Sorry, what?
SHERLOCK
You know what. You went out with 
her for two years.

DAVID
Yeah, ages ago. Just good friends 
now. 
SHERLOCK
Is that a fact?
(Flipping open his laptop)
Whenever she posts on Twitter, you 
respond within five minutes - 
regardless of time or your current 
location, which suggests you have 
her on text alert. In all your 
Facebook photographs of the happy 
couple, Mary is in centre frame and 
John is partially or entirely 
excluded -
DAVID
You can’t assume from that I’ve 
still got some kind of interest in 
Mary -
SHERLOCK
(The clincher)
You have volunteered to be a 
shoulder to cry on no less than 
three separate occasions!! Do you 
have anything to say in your 
defence?
David swallows hard. He’s got him bang to rights.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I think, in future, we’ll downgrade 
you to a casual acquaintance. No 
more than three planned social 
encounters a year, and always in 
John’s presence. I have your 
contact details, I will be 
monitoring.
DAVID
They’re right about you. You’re a 
bloody psychopath.
Sherlock just looks at him.
SHERLOCK
High functioning sociopath. With 
your number.

DAVID moves swiftly along the line, getting away from 
SHERLOCK as fast as he can.
A little PAGE BOY is next in line - velvet suit and lace 
collar. 
SHERLOCK
Hello, Archie. All ready?
And Archie just hugs SHERLOCK very hard. 
MUM
He’s really come of out his shell. 
I don’t know how you did it.

Flashback.
The Page Boys sits in John’s chair. Sherlock is in his own 
chair. Clock ticking silence.
SHERLOCK
So. Basically, it’s cute smile to 
the bride’s side, cute smile to the 
groom’s side, and then the rings.
PAGE BOY
No.
SHERLOCK
And of course, you have to wear the 
outfit.
PAGE BOY
No!
SHERLOCK
You really do have to wear it.
PAGE BOY
What for?
SHERLOCK
Grown ups like that sort of thing.
PAGE BOY
Why?
SHERLOCK
Not sure, I’ll ask one.
A beat of silence. The Page Boy registering that Sherlock 
maybe isn’t like the other grown ups.

Sherlock considers, then reaches for his laptop.
SHERLOCK
Yeah, why not?
CUT TO:
Sherlock and the Page Boy, pouring over the laptop, their 
faces illuminated by the screen. The little boy is thrilled 
and fascinated.

What’s all the stuff in his eye?

Sherlock flounders for a moment.

MOLLY with fiance TOM - kissing. Never miss an opportunity.

MRS. HUDSON has brought MR. CHATTERJEE. She’s wiping a canape 
off his mouth.

LESTRADE at the same table. He’s getting quietly sloshed.

John and Mary, laughing as they talk to someone. Mary is 
grabbing handfuls of the canapes.
MARY
Bloody starving - lost so much 
weight to get into this dress!
Click.
SHERLOCK and JANINE - they’re both scanning the room. There’s 
a DISHY WAITER bending over a silver salver dish. In it is a 
rack of delicious-looking lamb. Sherlock sniffs the air. 
JANINE
He’s nice.
SHERLOCK
(Sniffs)
Traces of two leading brands of 
deodorant, both advertised for 
strength. Suggestive of a chronic 
body odour problem, manifesting 
under stress.
Another WAITER arrives and starts talking to the first one. 
He withdraws a skewer from the lamb and juice spills out onto 
the salver. A tiny frown from Sherlock.

JANINE
Okay, done there. What about his 
friend? 
SHERLOCK
Long term relationship, compulsive 
cheat.
JANINE
Seriously?
SHERLOCK
Waterproof cover on his smartphone, 
but his complexion doesn’t indicate 
outdoor work. Suggests he’s in the 
habit of taking his phone into the 
shower, which indicates he often 
receives texts and emails he’d 
rather went unseen.
She looks at him, marveling.
JANINE
Can I keep you?
SHERLOCK
Do you like solving crimes?
JANINE
Do you have a vacancy?
He doesn’t reply for a beat - and Janine’s gaze goes straight 
to John.
JANINE (CONT’D)
Oh! I suppose you do!
Click.
JOHN and MARY are hovering. Not quite time to sit down yet.
MARY
Harry?
JOHN
(shakes head)
No show. 
MARY
Oh, I’m sorry, love. 
JOHN
Bit of a punt asking her. Still. 
Free bar. Wouldn’t have been a good 
mix. 
He smiles sadly. Then glances over Mary’s shoulder. Someone 
has walked casually into the reception. It’s MAJOR SHOLTO -

Oh God. Wow.

MARY
Is that - ?
JOHN
He came. 
Without a word, he moves swiftly up to Sholto and salutes. 
Sholto salutes back. Mary watches. 
SHERLOCK 
(a statement)
So that’s him. Major Sholto. 
Mary turns. Sherlock’s right behind her. 
MARY
Aha. 
SHERLOCK
(Is he jealous?)
If they’re such good friends, why 
does he hardly ever mention him?
MARY
(Teasing)
Mentions him all the time to me. 
Never shuts up about him.
SHERLOCK
(A little stung, almost 
affronted)
About him?
MARY
(Sips wine, makes as face)
I chose this wine - it’s bloody 
awful!
SHERLOCK
Yes, but it’s definitely him he 
talks about?
CUT TO:
JOHN and SHOLTO.
JOHN
I’m very, very glad you could make 
it, sir, I realise you don’t ... 
well, you don’t do this sort of 
thing any more.

SHOLTO
I do for old friends, Watson. 
(corrects himself)
John. Good to see you. 
JOHN
You too.
A slightly awkward silence. John can’t help glancing at 
Sholto’s scar. Sholto touches it self-consciously. 
SHOLTO
Civilian life suiting you, then?
JOHN
I think so, sir. 
SHOLTO
No more need for the trick cyclist? 
JOHN
Still go back now and then. Sort of 
top up. Therapy can be very 
helpful. 
Sholto just grunts, unconvinced. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
Where are you living these days?
SHOLTO
Oh. Way out in the middle of 
nowhere. 
(smiles)
You wouldn’t know it. 
CUT TO:
Back to Sherlock and Mary.
SHERLOCK
(Pointedly)
I’ve barely heard him speak his 
name.
MARY
He’s almost a recluse these days. 
Since...
SHERLOCK
Yes. 
MARY
I didn’t think he’d show at all - 
John says he’s the most unsociable 
man he’s ever met.

SHERLOCK

He is? He’s the most unsociable? Is 
that why he’s bouncing round him 
like a puppy?
A twinkle in her eye - a grin at the corner of her mouth. 
Enjoying SHERLOCK’S discomfort. She links arms with him.
MARY
Oh, Sherlock. Neither of us were 
the first, you know.
SHERLOCK
Stop smiling.
MARY
It’s my wedding day.
CUT TO:
INT. GYM. DAY.
12A
12A
CLOSE on feet in trainers, pounding away on a running 
machine. We pull up to see: MYCROFT! As we’ve never seen him 
before, in a grey jogging outfit; red-faced and exhausted. 
He’s in an expensive-looking gym, totally empty apart from 
him. He steps off the treadmill, panting with exertion. Then, 
surreptitiously, he lifts his sweatshirt and pats his 
stomach, checking his waistline. He looks pleased.

SHERLOCK
I’ve either caught you in a

been working out again. I favour 
the latter. 
MYCROFT
What do you want? 
SHERLOCK
I need your answer, Mycroft. As a 
matter of urgency. 
MYCROFT
Answer?
SHERLOCK
Even at the eleventh hour, it’s not 
too late you know. 
MYCROFT
Oh Lord -
SHERLOCK
Cars can be sent. Private jets 
commandeered -
MYCROFT
Today. It’s today, isn’t it?
(sighs)
No, Sherlock. I will not be coming 
to the ‘night do’, as you so 
poetically put it. 
SHERLOCK
Oh. That’s a shame. John and Mary 
will be extremely d-

SHERLOCK
No, no. I prefer to think of it as

Mycroft smiles to himself. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
What? 
MYCROFT
Nothing.
SHERLOCK
I know that silence. What?? 
MYCROFT
I’d better let you get back to it. 
You have a big speech or something, 
don’t you?
SHERLOCK
What??
MYCROFT
Cakes. Karaoke. Mingling. 
SHERLOCK
Mycroft!
MYCROFT
This is what people do, Sherlock. 
They get married. I warned you. 
Don’t get involved. 
SHERLOCK

By the way, Sherlock, do you

This brings Sherlock up short. A memory - almost like a code

No. Of course you’re not. Enjoy not

LESTRADE
He will, won’t he? He’s bound to.
MOLLY

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
First things first. Telegrams. Well 
they’re not actually telegrams. We 
just call them telegrams, don’t 
know why. Wedding tradition. 
Because we don’t have enough of 
that already, apparently.
SHERLOCK has a bunch of telegrams - reading them with no 
apparent feeling or warmth - a rather agonising task for him -
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
‘To John and Mary. All good wishes 
for your special day. With love 
and...
(Do I really have to say 
this?)
... many big squishy cuddles from 
Stella and Ted’.
John and Mary enjoy this.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(Takes another)
‘So sorry I’m unable to be with 
you...Mike Stamford...
(another)
‘Lots of love...’
And he falters.
JOHN
Yes?
SHERLOCK
(Finds this word almost 
impossible)
...poppet. Oodles of love and heaps 
of good wishes from Cam. Wish your 
family could’ve have seen this’.
A beat on Mary as she turn, away, moved. John squeezes her 
hand. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(Takes another, skim 
reads)
...’special day’...
(And another)
...’special day’, ‘very special 
day’... ‘love’, ‘love’, ‘love’. Bit 
of a theme. You get the general 
gist. People are basically fond.

JOHN
Sherlock?

What was that noise downstairs?

Mrs. Hudson laughing.
SHERLOCK
I thought perhaps she was torturing 
an owl.
JOHN
No, it was laughter.
SHERLOCK
It could have been both.
John, looking at the eyeball and the flame-thrower.
JOHN
Busy?
SHERLOCK
Just occupying myself - sometimes

SHERLOCK
Billy Kincaid.
JOHN
I’m sorry?
SHERLOCK
Billy Kincaid, the Camden 
Garrotter. Best man I ever knew. 
Vast contributions to charity, all 
undisclosed, personally saved three 
hospitals from closure, ran the 
best and safest children’s homes in 
the north of England, and yes, now 
and then, garrotted people. But if 
you stack up all the lives saved, 
against the garrottings, on 
balance, I’d say -
JOHN
For my wedding. For me. I need a 
best man.
SHERLOCK
Oh, right.
JOHN
Maybe not a garrotter
SHERLOCK
Gavin.
JOHN
Sorry, what?
SHERLOCK
Gavin Lestrade, he’s a man, he’s

On Sherlock. A pause. Bracing himself for the ordeal. 
Cutting round Molly, Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, John and Mary - 
please be okay!!
Sherlock clears his throat - launching into the speech, 
proper. Here goes. Consults his notes.
SHERLOCK
I’m afraid, John, I can’t 
congratulate you. All emotion, and 
love in particular, stand opposed 
to that pure, cold reason that I 
hold above all things. A wedding 
is, in my considered opinion, 
nothing short of a celebration of 
all that is false and specious and 
irrational and sentimental in this 
ailing and morally compromised 
world. We honour today the death 
watch beetle that is the doom of 
our society, and in time, one feels 
certain, our entire species. But 
anyway, let’s talk about John!! If 
I burden myself with a little 
helpmate during my adventures, it 
is not done out of sentiment or 
caprice. It is that John has many 
fine qualities of his own that he 
has overlooked in his infatuation 
with me. Indeed any reputation I 
have for sharpness comes, in truth, 
from the extraordinary contrast 
John selflessly provides.
On John - appalled and hurt.

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
It is a fact, I believe, that 
brides tend to favour exceptionally 
plain bridesmaids for their big 
day. There is a certain analogy, I 
feel.
On the bridesmaids - appalled and hurt.
The whole room is slowly freezing over.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Contrast is, after all, God’s own 
plan to enhance the beauty of his 
creation. Or would be, if God were 
not a ludicrous fantasy designed to 
provide a career opportunity for 
the family idiot.
On the Vicar, appalled and insulted.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
The point I’m trying to make is 
this. I am the most unpleasant, 
ignorant, rude, all round obnoxious 
git anyone is ever likely to meet. 
I am dismissive of the virtuous -
(Nods the vicar)
- unaware of the beautiful -
(Janine)
- and uncomprehending in the face
of the happy.
(The whole audience)
So if I didn’t understand I was 
being offered the chance to be best 
man, it is because I never expected 
to be anyone’s best friend. And 
certainly not the best friend of 
the bravest, kindest, wisest human 
being I have ever been privileged 
to know. John, I am a ridiculous 
man, redeemed only by the warmth 
and constancy of your friendship. 
But since I am, apparently, your 
best friend I cannot congratulate 
you on your choice of companion.
(Looks to Mary)
Well! Now I can! Mary, when I say 
you deserve this man, it is the 
greatest compliment of which I am 
capable. John, you have endured 
war, injury and tragic loss - 
sorry, again, about that - so 
please know this. Today you are 
sitting with the woman you have 
made your wife and the man you 
saved.

Now on John. Pole-axed. Tears in his eyes. Desperately trying 
not to sniffle. 
Cutting round the others - the whole room, so moved. Sniffles 
everywhere. Mrs. Hudson openly crying. Sholto smiles to 
himself, touched. 
John now trying to conceal his emotional disarray, in a

If I try to bloody hug him, stop

Certainly not.

Sherlock, at the centre of it all, as ever oblivious.
SHERLOCK

John -
He looks up from his notes, becomes aware that practically 
the whole room is crying.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
What’s wrong, what’s happened? Why 
are you all doing that. John?
MRS. HUDSON
(Can’t hold it in)
Oh, Sherlock!
Floods of tears now.
SHERLOCK

don’t see why not...
She wanders off into the back corridor area, beyond the 
kitchen.
JOHN
(to Sherlock)
If that’s Beth, that’s probably me 
too, hang on -
He dashes after Mary, leaving Sherlock contemplating his 
serviettes.
Back corridor - Mary is waiting for John, no phone at her ear 
now. Conversation conducted in whispers.
JOHN (CONT’D)
He knows we don’t have a friend 
called Beth, he’s going to figure 
out it’s code -
MARY
He’s YouTubing serviettes.
JOHN
He’s thorough!
MARY
He’s terrified!
JOHN
Of course he’s not.
MARY
You know when you’re scared of 
something’s that coming, and you 
start wishing it sooner, just to 
get started. That’s what he’s 
doing!
JOHN
Why would he be scared of us 
getting married? Nothing’s going to 
change, we’ll still do stuff.
MARY
Prove it to him. I told you to find 
him a case.
JOHN
I’m trying.
MARY
You need to run him. Show him it’s 
still the good old days.

MARY (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)


She practically shoves him back into the living room. John 
stumbles back in on Sherlock -
- who’s now folded an whole array of serviettes in record 
time. He looks up almost guiltily.
SHERLOCK
That just sort of happened.
John, resolved now, goes to Sherlock - lowers his voice as if 
to stop Mary hearing (play acting for Sherlock.)
JOHN
Sherlock, mate, I’ve smelled 
eighteen different perfumes. I’ve 
sampled nine different slices of 
cake that all tasted identical. I 
like the Bridesmaids in purple.
SHERLOCK
Lilac.
JOHN
Lilac! There aren’t any decisions 
left to make! I don’t even 
understand the ones we’ve made. I’m 
faking opinions, it’s exhausting. 
Now please, before she starts again 
- pick something!
Thrusts his phone under SHERLOCK’S nose.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Anything! Pick one. 
SHERLOCK
Pick what?
JOHN
A case! Your inbox is bursting. Get 
me out of here. 
SHERLOCK
You want to go out on a case? Now?
JOHN
Sherlock, please, for me.
Sherlock inwardly delightedly, outwardly selfless.
SHERLOCK
Don’t worry about a thing - I’ll 
get you out of this!
SHERLOCK is already scrolling down the list. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Ah!!

JOHN taps the inbox and one of the emails floods our screen: 
‘DEAR MR. HOLMES...’
The voice of the correspondent narrating - 
EXT/INT. ARMY BARRACKS. DAY
43
43
The Wellington barracks in London. Birdcage Walk.
The Queen’s Grenadier Guard - the Busbies - are barracked 
here, right in the shadow of Buckingham Palace.
An elegant and imposing Georgian building made of honey-
coloured stone. It’s surrounded by a high perimeter wall with 
a row of punitive metal spikes. 
A GUARDSMEN on duty outside the barracks in a sentry box. The 
traditional red tunic, Sam Browne belt, gold-braided 
trousers. And the absurdly large Busby hat.
We hear the voice of PRIVATE BAINBRIDGE -
Very plummy - from the upper echelons, your typical 
GUARDSMAN. 
BAINBRIDGE (V.O.)
Dear Mr. Holmes. My name is 
Bainbridge. I’m Private in Her 
Majesty’s Household Guard...
CUT TO:
Inside the barracks - 
The place is old and drenched in tradition. Wood-panelled 
walls. Flagstone floors. 
SOLDIERS in their red coats, braided trousers and busbies 
marching past.
One of them is BAINBRIDGE. Tall, slim, trim.
BAINBRIDGE (V.O.)
I’m writing to you about a personal 
matter - one I don’t care to bring 
before my superiors. It would sound 
so trivial...
EXT. BARRACKS. DAY.

BAINBRIDGE is on duty. The classic pose of the Busby-wearing 
guardsman in his sentry box. 
BAINBRIDGE (V.O.)
But I think someone is stalking me.

Two JAPANESE TOURISTS stand either side of him, giggling with 
excitement. They take photos of themselves. Bainbridge’s face 
remains impassive. 
BAINBRIDGE (V.O.)
I’m used to tourists. It’s part of 
the job. But this is different. 
Someone’s watching me. He’s taking 
pictures of me. Every day. 
CUT TO:
INT.BAINBRIDGE’S QUARTERS. DAY.

BAINBRIDGE is in a towel, ready to have a shower. He glances 
out of the window. Distantly, a figure is watching. 
BAINBRIDGE (V.O.)
I don’t want to mention it to the 
Colonel. But it’s really preying on 
my mind. I’ve read about you and I 
know this sort of thing wouldn’t 
interest the police...

SHERLOCK
Uniform fetishist? All the nice 
girls love a soldier.  
JOHN
It’s sailors. And Bainbridge thinks 
his stalker is a bloke. Let’s go 
and investigate. Please. 
SHERLOCK studies the email. His curiosity is just beginning 
to be teased.
SHERLOCK
Elite guard. 
JOHN
Forty enlisted men and officers.
SHERLOCK
(starting to get 
interested)
Why this particular Grenadier? 
Curious.
JOHN
Now you’re talking.

SHERLOCK
Ok.
MARY reappears, play-acting ending her call. 
Now John is play-acting a guilty thing surprised.
JOHN
Um...we’re just...I want Sherlock 
to help me choose some...
And he can’t think of a single credible lie. So MARY helps 
him out.
MARY
Why not go with ‘socks’?
JOHN
Yep. 
MARY
Got to get the right ones. 
JOHN
Yep. To go with my outfit.
MARY gives them an indulgent smile.
MARY
It’ll probably take you a while, 
that.
JOHN
Is my coat in there?
He dashes past her into the kitchen.  
Sherlock leans conspiratorially to Mary.
SHERLOCK
Just need to get him out for a bit - 
run him.
MARY
I know. You said you were going to 
find him case!
John, in the kitchen, heading to the door.
JOHN
Come on Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
Coming!

As they both head out, they each turn to Mary - Sherlock at

On Mary, laughing - oh, her boys!

JOHN is presenting his credentials. A DUTY OFFICER is 
stationed at the guard house - the red and gold of the 
Grenadiers. 
JOHN
We’re here to see Private Steven 
Bainbridge.
DUTY OFFICER
He’s on duty right now, sir. 
He nods across the parade ground. 
BAINBRIDGE is stationed in his sentry box. 
Motionless.
DUTY OFFICER (CONT’D)
But I’ll certainly let him know 
when he’s free.
SHERLOCK
How long does he stay like that? 
DUTY OFFICER
(smiles)
Another hour. 
On Bainbridge again, face utterly impassive.

JOHN and SHERLOCK sit on a bench in St. James’ Park.
Fifty yards away they can see BAINBRIDGE on duty, stock 
still.
A TOURIST has set up a camera on a tripod. He holds the timer 
button as he stands next to Bainbridge and -
Click -
- takes a photo. 
SHERLOCK
You think they give them classes?
JOHN
Classes?
SHERLOCK
Resisting the temptation to scratch 
their behinds. 
JOHN
Afferent neurons in the peripheral 
nervous system.
Beat.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Bum itch.
The Tourist walks off. 
SHERLOCK
So. Why don’t you see him any more?
JOHN
Who? 
SHERLOCK
This previous commander of yours. 
Sholto. 
JOHN
Previous commander?
SHERLOCK
I meant ex.
JOHN
“Previous” would suggest I 
currently have a commander. 
SHERLOCK
(Soothingly)
Which you don’t.

(CONTINUED)


JOHN
Which I don’t.
SHERLOCK
Of course you don’t. You think 
highly of him. He was your previous 
best friend ... ex-best friend. 
Whatever he was, why don’t you keep 
in touch.
JOHN
He doesn’t. Long story - he had a 
bad time out there.
SHERLOCK
Decorated, wasn’t he? He’s a war 
hero.
JOHN
Not to everyone. He led a team of 
crows into battle. 
SHERLOCK
Crows?
JOHN
New recruits. Standard procedure, 
break in the new boys - but it went 
wrong. All the rookies died, he was 
the only survivor. The press and 
the families gave him hell. Gets 
more death threats than you. 
SHERLOCK
Oh, I wouldn’t count on that!
JOHN
And why are you suddenly taking an 
interest in another human being?
SHERLOCK
I’m ... chatting.
JOHN
Okay, scared now.
SHERLOCK
Well I’m not going to try that 
again.
JOHN
He’s a good man. A brave man. And 
he was a very good friend to me.
SHERLOCK
“Was”?

SHERLOCK
Oh. Good.
JOHN
If you were worried.
SHERLOCK
Wasn’t worried.
Beat. 
John - he’s got something to say. Can’t quite meet Sherlock’s 
eye, when he does so. The gruff soldier, with stuff to talk 
about it.
JOHN
You know ... the thing about Mary. 
She’s completely turned my life 
around. She’s changed everything. 
But for the record, over the last 
few years, there have been two 
people who’ve done that. And the 
other one is ...
He turns. Sherlock’s not there. 
JOHN (CONT’D)

He looks round. No Sherlock. 
John looks over at Bainbridge.

With John is the starchy Colonel who’s peering suspiciously 
at John’s ID.
REED
Can I ask what this is in 
connection with?
JOHN
Private Bainbridge contacted us 
about a...personal matter, sir. 
REED
Nothing’s ‘personal’ when it 
concerns my troops. 
He peers at John.
REED (CONT’D)
What do you really want?
JOHN
I’m here on a legitimate enquiry.
REED
Press? Digging for some bloody 
Royal story or something?
JOHN
No, sir. I’m Captain John Watson -

Bainbridge want with a detective?
JOHN
I’m not at liberty to say.

John makes to move. Reed stops him.

JOHN
I’m a doctor!

Oh, you’re a doctor now too! 
Sergeant!

JOHN
Please, let me examine him!

SHERLOCK in an arm lock.

Is that what this was all about?

JOHN
Don’t be stupid!
Sherlock scans the room in an instant. The body. The smashed 
door. 
SHERLOCK
Kill him with what? Where’s the 
weapon? 
REED
What?
SHERLOCK
Search me. Go ahead. No weapon.
JOHN
Bainbridge was on parade. He only 
left his sentry box five minutes 
ago. When is this supposed to have 
happened? 
REED
(to Sherlock)
You obviously stabbed him before he 
got into the shower. 
SHERLOCK
No. 
REED
No?
SHERLOCK
He’s soaking wet and there’s 
shampoo in his hair. He got into 
the shower and then someone stabbed 
him. 
DUTY OFFICER 
The cubicle was locked from the 
inside, sir. I had to break it 
open. 
REED
You must’ve climbed over the top.

At last, Reed nods. John tears over to Bainbridge and rapidly 
examines him.
DUTY OFFICER
Suicide?
SHERLOCK
No. The weapon again. No knife. 
JOHN
There’s a wound in the abdomen. But 
it’s incredibly fine --
John suddenly puts his ear to Bainbridge’s chest. Frowns.
Sherlock checks Bainbridge’s hands but they are empty. Then, 
astonishingly, he licks water off the floor. 
SHERLOCK
Man lies stabbed to death. No 
murder weapon. Door locked from the 
inside. Only one way in or out of 
here. 
JOHN
Sherlock! He’s still breathing!!
DUTY OFFICER
Oh my God.
SHERLOCK
... what do we do??
JOHN
(To Bainbridge)
It’s alright, it’s alright, son. 
(To Sherlock)
Give me your scarf - now, quickly!
SHERLOCK hurriedly hands him his scarf. John, the army 
soldier, totally back in his element.
JOHN uses it as a makeshift bandage.

Back to the speech...
SHERLOCK
Private Bainbridge had just come 
off guard duty. Stood there for an 
hour with plenty of people 
watching. Nothing apparently wrong 
with him. He came off duty and, 
within minutes, he was almost dead 
from a wound in his stomach.
The whole wedding crowd are rapt, hanging on his every word. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
But no weapon. So. Where did it go? 
Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you 
to consider this. A murderer who 
can walk through walls. A weapon 
which can vanish. And yet, in all 
of this, there is only element 
which can be said to be truly 
remarkable. Would anyone like to 
make a guess.
He looks around. Silence. What?
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Well, come on, come on. There is a 
Q and A element to this. Scotland 
Yard, what’s your theory?
He’s rounded on poor old Lestrade.

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Yes, you. You’re a detective, 
broadly speaking - got a theory?
People are turning to look at Lestrade. He shifts 
uncomfortably in his chair.
LESTRADE
If the blade was propelled 
somehow.... Through the grating on 
the air vent. Maybe a ballista or a 
catapult. Somebody tiny could crawl 
through there. We’re obviously 
looking for a dwarf. 
SHERLOCK
Brilliant.
LESTRADE
Really?
SHERLOCK
No. Next!  
TOM
Stabbed himself.
SHERLOCK
Hello, who was that?
Molly’s boyfriend TOM, getting hesitantly to his feet.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Ah! Tom. What was your theory?
TOM
Attempted suicide. With a blade 
made of compacted blood and bone. 
Broke after piercing his abdomen.
Sherlock looks sceptical. 
TOM (CONT’D)
(losing confidence)
Like a meat...dagger. 
SHERLOCK
A meat dagger.
TOM
Yeah.
MOLLY
(hissed whisper)
Sit down! 
Tom sits down, a little crushed.

SHERLOCK
No, there was one, and only one, 
feature of interest in this whole 
baffling case. And that was, 
frankly, the usual. John Watson. 
Who, while I tried to solve a 
murder, instead, saved a life. Some 
mysteries are worth solving, some 
stories are worth telling. The best 
and bravest man I’ve ever known, 
and on top of that, actually knows 
how to do stuff. Except wedding 
planning and serviettes, he’s 
rubbish at those. The case itself 
remains the most ingenious and 
brilliantly planned murder - or 
attempted murder - I have ever had 
the pleasure of encountering. The 
most perfect locked room mystery of 
which I am aware.
A beat. The audience expectant.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
However, I’m not just here to 
praise John, I’m also here to 
embarrass him, so let me move on -
An outraged mutter among the guests, and now Lestrade shouts 
out.
LESTRADE
But how was it done? Aren’t you 
going to tell us?
SHERLOCK
How was what done?
LESTRADE
The murder, the stabbing. 
SHERLOCK
Oh, I’ve no idea, I never solved 
that one. That happens sometimes, 
it’s very disappointing.
(Back to his notes)
Embarrassment, of course, leads me 
to the stag night. Frankly there 
are hours of material here, but 
I’ve cut it down into the really 
good bits ...

Where you’ve found a corpse. That’s 
lovely. Why d’you need me?
SHERLOCK
Don’t want us getting ill. That

MOLLY
You’re a graduate chemist. Can’t 
you work it out?

I lack...practical experience. 
MOLLY

INT. BAR. NIGHT

SHERLOCK, completely blotto, in the middle of a bar fight 
with a pissed up THUG.
He’s pointing at the THUG’S hoodie and yelling.
SHERLOCK
Listen, I’m telling you - on 
your...hoodie. That’s ash from a 
Marlboro light! 
THUG
I never smoke lights. Girls’ fags!
SHERLOCK
(Yelling)
I know ash! Don’t tell me I don’t! 
The THUG takes a swing at SHERLOCK which he narrowly dodges.
SHERLOCK takes a swing back. JOHN drags him out...

Red line crisscrossing London in no ordered fashion 
whatsoever.

it’s for.

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Crime-something-or-other.
Wide -
SHERLOCK and JOHN lying prostrate, at the foot of the stoop 
in BAKER STREET.
Both plastered. 
Climbing the small flight of stairs has presented too much of 
a challenge. 
And then MRS. HUDSON comes out with her recycling.
MRS. HUDSON
What you doing back? I thought 
you’d be out late.
SHERLOCK
What time is it?
MRS. HUDSON
(Checks her watch)
You’ve only been out two hours! 
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT.

SHERLOCK and JOHN sit facing each other in the classic pose. 
Except they both have Rizlas stuck to their foreheads. 
John’s reads ‘Madonna’. Sherlock’s reads ‘Sherlock Holmes’. 
They’re both still completely plastered.
JOHN
Am I...a vegetable?

Sometimes. 
SHERLOCK
Can’t have sometimes. Has to be yes

Yes. Human. 
SHERLOCK
A man?
JOHN
Yup.
SHERLOCK
Tall?
JOHN
Not as tall as people think.
SHERLOCK
Nice?
JOHN
Ish.
SHERLOCK
Clever?

I’d say so.

Am I a woman?
SHERLOCK
Yes.

SHERLOCK
Beauty is a construct based 
entirely on childhood influences, 
impressions and role models -
JOHN
Yeah. But am I a pretty lady?
SHERLOCK
I don’t know. I don’t know who 
you’re supposed to be. 
JOHN
You picked the name!

them up the wrong way. 
He smiles drunkenly and smugly. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Got it. 
JOHN
Go on, then.
SHERLOCK
I’m you, aren’t I!
He whips the Rizla off his forehead and peers dumbly at it. 
Knock-knock. 
MRS HUDSON
Ooh-ooh. Client. 
Sherlock and John look up. A woman, TESSA, is framed in the 
doorway. She’s just come straight from work. Nurse’s uniform. 
SHERLOCK AND JOHN

Hello!

TESSA sits on a high-backed chair to deliver her exposition. 
Rather a heightened emotional tale. 
JOHN and SHERLOCK sit opposite, side by side (backs to us).
TESSA
I don’t... a lot. I mean... I don’t 
date all that much. And he 
seemed... nice. You know. We seemed 
just automatically to connect.
No response from them, so she ploughs on.
TESSA (CONT’D)
We had one night. Dinner. Such 
interesting conversation.  It was 
lovely.

To be honest, I’d love to have gone

special. Let’s take it slowly. 
Exchanged numbers. Said he’d get in 
touch. And then -
(Beat)
Maybe he wasn’t quite as keen as I 
was - but I thought... I just 
thought... at least he’d call to 
say we were finished.
(Starts to tear up, this 
is painful)
I went round there. To his flat. No 
trace of him. Mr. Holmes... 
(big reveal)
I honestly think I had dinner with 
a ghost! 
TESSA’S face falls. 
She’s disappointed it didn’t have more of an effect.
TESSA (CONT’D)
Mr. Holmes?
Camera turns round. 
JOHN and SHERLOCK are asleep, leaning on their fists - eyes 
half-open. 
TESSA leans forward and prods SHERLOCK. His arm falls off his 
chair and jerks him awake.
SHERLOCK
(Still pissed)
Boring boring. No - wait. Sorry. 
Fascinating.  
(Nudges John)
Pay attention, John. Sorry about my 
colleague. Rude. Rude.
He burps.
TESSA
I checked with the Landlord. The 
man who lived there died. Heart 
attack. And there we are - having 
dinner one week on. 
(Fishing in her bag)
I’ve found this thing online... a 
sort of chat room. For girls who 
think they’re dating men from the 
spirit world. 
Shows them the printed pages - 
SHERLOCK leaps to his feet. The game is on. Even though 
they’re still pissed.

An empty flat - 
TESSA with SHERLOCK and JOHN perusing the place - the scene 
of her one-night stand. 
Typical bachelor pad. Sparse but opulent.
The LANDLORD stands at the door, swinging the key. 
Unimpressed by this late intrusion by two piss-heads claiming 
to be detectives.
JOHN is forced to prop himself up against a wall for support. 
Smiles inanely at the LANDLORD, trying to pretend that 
everything is OK. 
JOHN
(slurred)
Nice. Nice place.
SHERLOCK - rather boldly - trying to walk the room and do his 
thing. 
TESSA
See anything? 
(Beat)
Any clues, Mr. Holmes?
SHERLOCK blinks hard and looks around the room.

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Let me just whip this out -
SHERLOCK tries to whip out his magnifying lens - a ridiculous 
dance because it’s stuck sideways in his pocket. 
Eventually retrieves the thing by pulling his coat half 
inside-out.
Kneels down on the floor to examine the pile of the carpet.
TESSA
(To John)
You alright?
JOHN
Clueing.
TESSA
What?
JOHN
(Points at Sherlock)
He’s clueing. For looks. 
TESSA

SHERLOCK has fallen asleep on top of his magnifying glass - 
right there on the floor.
TESSA (CONT’D)
Mr. Holmes?
LANDLORD
I’m calling the police.
TESSA
No, no! This is a famous detective. 
Sherlock Holmes. And his partner - 
John Hamish Watson.

Wakey wakey.
Turns JOHN over with his foot.
JOHN
Oh my God.

Greg. Is it Greg?
LESTRADE
Get up. I’m putting you two in a

JOHN staggers to his feet.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
What a couple of lightweights. 
Couldn’t even make it to closing

Not really.
He slaps JOHN playfully on the back, and nearly decks him.

Mrs Hudson nods. 
MRS HUDSON
You might not think it but it does.   
Different phase of your life. You 
meet new people ‘cos you’re a 
couple. You let old friends slip 
away. 
JOHN
It won’t be like that. 
Mrs Hudson just shrugs. 
MRS HUDSON
If you’ve found the right one. The 
person you click with, then that’s 
the best thing in the world.

I have. I know I have. 
Mrs Hudson nods, a bit teary.

Drugs?
MRS. HUDSON
Oh yes. He was running a 
whatchamacallit...a cartel. Got in 
with a very bad crowd.
JOHN
Oh. 
MRS. HUDSON
And then I found out about all the 
other women. I didn’t have a clue. 
So when he actually got arrested 
for blowing someone’s head off it 
was a bit of a relief, to be 
honest.
JOHN
Aha. 
MRS. HUDSON

No, it was purely physical with me

SHERLOCK
(Nods at the screen)
There’re going to be others. 
JOHN
Others?
SHERLOCK
Victims. Women. Most ghosts - they 
tend to haunt a single house. This 
ghost, however, he’s willing to 
commute. Look.
He has put the locations of the ‘haunted shags’ on a map - 
A series of pins dropped all over North London.
On SHERLOCK. Lost in thought.

There are about fifty people in the room, scattered around in 
the seats. 
Through the entrance-way walks SHERLOCK.
And all the people get to their feet.
Sherlock strides to the centre, as if about to give a 
lecture, then spins on the spot, a 360 turn around the 
structure.
He addresses each person in turn.

think that was what made me special 
- quite frankly, I still do. But a
word to the wise, should any of you
ever require the services of either
of us. I’ll solve your murder - but
it takes John Watson to save your
life. You may trust me on that - he
has saved mine, so many times, and
in so many ways.
(Holds up the smartphone)
This blog has been the story of two 
men, and their frankly ridiculous 
adventures. Of murder and mystery 
and mayhem. But from now on there’s 
a new story. A bigger adventure. 
Ladies and gentlemen, charge your 
glasses and be upstanding. 
The room getting to its feet. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Today begin the adventures of my 
Mary Elizabeth Watson and John 
Hamish Watson - the two reasons 
every single of one us is -
And he breaks off -
Pause.
Really absurdly long pause.

SHERLOCK just leaves them all hanging there, glass raised.
Close on Sherlock - and you can see it. The brain is 
spinning, powering up. You can almost hear it, like the 
building whine of aircraft engines 
Close on the raised glass in his hand -
- it starts to slip from his fingers, falling.
The motion slows, and slows, almost to a stope. We’re 
entering Sherlock Time! 
The whole room freezing into super-slow motion.
On the falling glass, turning in agonising slowness - lights 
flashes and refracts through the crystal facet-
Close on Sherlock’s eyes - normal speed. His eyes blink shut!

On Sherlock as his eyes open. He’s back in the mind palace. 
Lights spinning round the room, as if refracting through the 
crystal glass - reality bleeding through.
Around him, positioned as before, the five women. Gail, 
Charlotte, Robyn, Vicky, Tessa. Now standing solemn and 
silent - as if dormant now that he’s now got them on his 
computer. Just images.
Sherlock spins, rounding on Tessa.

Out of my head, I’m busy!
She vanishes.

Sherlock, John and Mary, grouped round a computer, working on 
something. They’re in wedding planning mode.
JOHN
Does it have to be on the 
invitation?
MARY
It’s your name.
MARY (CONT’D)
It’s traditional.
SHERLOCK
It’s funny.
On the computer screen, the invitation, zeroing in on a 
detail -
“... the wedding of and Mary Elizabeth Morstan and John 
Hamish Watson ... “
INT. ROUND ROOM. DAY.
91

On Tessa, she speaks, the words she spoke before.
TESSA
Enjoy the wedding. 
SHERLOCK
You knew about the wedding - more 
than that. You’d seen the 
invitation. Now barely a hundred 
people have seen that invitation, 
and the Mayfly man only saw five 
women - for one person to be in 
both those groups ... it could be 
coincidence.
MYCROFT
(From off; scolding)
Oh, Sherlock! 
Sherlock spin. Mycroft stands at the podium, like the Prime 
Minister of Reason.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
What do we say about coincidence?
SHERLOCK
The universe is rarely so lazy.
MYCROFT
So the balance of probability is 
... ?

On the falling glass as it finally hits the table - normal 
speed again (it either smashes or spills, depending what is 
credible.)  And Sherlock finally finishes what we he was 
saying.
SHERLOCK
- here today.
The room on its feet staring at him. For them, hardly a 
second has passed. Sherlock has momentarily paused, and 
dropped his glass. Nothing else is going on as far they’re 
concerned - the above was barely a blink.
Sherlock, momentarily fuddled. That blizzard of deduction, of 
insight almost destabilising him.
Looks down at the fallen glass.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Sorry. Butter fingers ...

The guests all looking at each other. What? They all start to 
resume their seats.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(Suddenly adopts a big 
smile)
Ladies and gentlemen. Everyone 
tells you not to milk a good 
speech. Get off early. Leave ‘em 
laughing. Wise advice I shall 
certainly keep in mind. But for now 
... part two!
John and Mary look worried. 
Sherlock’s in uncharted territory. Totally busking it!

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Part two’s different. More action-
based, going to move around, shake 
it up a bit.
As he speaks, he vaults causally over the top table, starts 
to wander round the room. He’s barely listening to what he’s 
saying, he’s on high alert. Scanning the room, raking through 
it. He’s just left his voice running as a cover.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Who’d come to a wedding, that’s the 
question. Who’d bother going to any 
lengths to get themselves to a 
wedding?
Sherlock’s POV. The text Mayfly Man? is hanging over every 
man’s head.  Sherlock frowns, almost panicking. Too many, too 
little time.
Everyone’s a bit restive at what he’s saying. He quickly 
attempts to recover.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Well everyone would, because 
wedding’s are great, love a 
wedding.
On John and Mary, watching - it was going so well. A 
whispered exchange.
MARY
What’s he doing??
John’s way ahead of her, watching his friend intently.
JOHN
Something’s wrong.
SHERLOCK
And John’s great, haven’t said that 
enough. I’ve barely scratched the 
surface. I could go on all night 
about the depth and the complexity 
of his ..... jumpers. And he can 
cook. Does a great...um...thing. A 
thing with peas. Once. Might not 
have been peas. Might not have been 
him. And he’s got a great singing 
voice. Or somebody has. 
Scans the room again. The text Mayfly Man disappearing over 
the heads of the older men. But still, so many younger ones
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Too many, too many!!
The room startles.

SHERLOCK
- murder.
The room - what??
John, focussed - where’s this going?
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Sorry, did I say murder. I meant 
marriage. But, you know, very 
similar procedures, when you think 
about it. The participants tend to 
know each other, and it’s over when 
one of them dies. In fairness, 
though, murder’s a lot quicker.

Janine, at the top table, startles at her name being called.
Sherlock has darted over to another couple. He points to the 
man.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
What about this one? Acceptably 
hot. More importantly, his 
girlfriend is wearing brand new, 
uncomfortable underwear, but hasn’t 
bothered to remove this thread from 
his jacket or mention to him the 
grease smudge on the back on his 
neck. Currently he’s going home 
alone. 
Janine, blushing. The couple, looking at each other, 
horrified. We now see Sherlock, his phone behind his back, 
discreetly texting at hyper-speed!
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Also, he’s a comics and sci-fi geek 
- they’re always tremendously
grateful and really put the hours
in.
(To Lestrade)
Jeff, the Gents.
LESTRADE
Greg!
SHERLOCK
The loo, now please!
LESTRADE
Why? 
SHERLOCK
I don’t know, it’s your go.
Now Lestrade’s phone pings. He checks the text. 
On-screen: Lock this place down. 
He glances up at Sherlock. Just for a second, Sherlock gives 
him a look of deadly seriousness. Lestrade, getting up now
LESTRADE
Yep, now that you mention it.
He’s hurrying to the exit. 
John, watching him - something’s up! Danger in the room. Now 
calls out to Sherlock - jocular.

He just adds the last two words, casually appending them to 
the sentence.
Their eyes meet for a deadly serious moment.

The guests staring at him - he’s completely lost it.
Sherlock rounds on John. Striding over to him.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)

Watson, you keep me right.
The guests - confused now, this speech has definitely gone

Swivels round to look at the guests, eyes alight.
Sherlock’s POV. The Mayfly Man? texts bobbing round the heads 
as before ...
Sherlock sweeps his hand through the frame, clearing the 
texts -
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Don’t solve the murder ...
Sweeps his hand through again, and now there a new texts 
above everybody’s heads - TARGET?
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)

The staring guests? WTF??
A beaming smile from Sherlock.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Sorry. Off-piste, tiny bit, back 
on, phew! Let’s play a game. Let’s 
play murder!
Mrs. Hudson rolls her eyes. Pitying.
MRS. HUDSON
Oh, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
Imagine someone’s going to get 
murdered at a wedding. Who exactly 
would you pick? 
MRS. HUDSON
(Mutters)
I think you might be a popular 
choice at the moment, dear.
SHERLOCK
(to Mrs. Hudson’s 
neighbour)
If you could move Mrs. Hudson’s 
glass a fraction out of reach, that 
would be lovely. 
(Back to speech)
More especially, who could you only 
kill at a wedding?

Most people you can kill any old 
place. As a mental exercise, I’ve 
often planned the murder of my 
friends and colleagues. Now John, 
I’d poison. Sloppy eater, dead 
easy. I’ve tried out many chemicals 
and compounds on him that way, he’s 
never even noticed. He missed a 
whole Wednesday once, didn’t have a 
clue. Lestrade’s so easy to kill 
it’s a miracle no one’s succumbed 
to the temptation. I have a set of 
my brother’s house keys, I could 
break in any time and asphyxiate 
him, if the whim arose. 
On Tom and Molly watching. Molly is rapt, Tom is bemused. He 
lands a hand on Molly’s arm.
TOM
He’s pissed, isn’t he?
Without taking her eyes off Sherlock, Molly reaches for a 
fork and stabs Tom’s hand.
SHERLOCK
So! Again! Who could you only kill 
here. Clearly this must be a rare 
opportunity so it’s someone who 
doesn’t get out much.
As he walks round the room, people start simply disappearing 
from their chairs, as Sherlock’s dismisses them from 
consideration - all the people who do get out much.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Someone for whom a planned social 
encounter, known about months in 
advance, is an exception. This has 
to be a unique opportunity.
More people disappearing.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Since killing someone in public is 
difficult, killing them in private 
can’t be an option. Someone who 
lives in an inaccessible or unknown 
location then.
More people disappearing.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Perhaps someone private, someone 
obsessive about personal security, 
possibly someone under threat.

SHERLOCK
In fairness to me, he’s a drama 
Queen too.
MARY
I know.
Sherlock rounds on the door.
SHERLOCK
Major Sholto, no one is coming to 
kill you. I’m afraid you were 
killed several hours ago.
SHOLTO
I’m sorry? What did you say?
SHERLOCK
Don’t take your belt off.
SHOLTO
My belt.
Sherlock rounds on John and Mary.
SHERLOCK
His belt, yes. Bainbridge was 
stabbed hours before we even saw 
him - but through his belt.

A tight belt worn high on his 
waist. Push a tiny blade through 
the hole, you wouldn’t even feel 
it.
JOHN
The belt would bind the flesh 
together, when it was tied tight.
SHERLOCK
Exactly.
JOHN
But when you took it off ...
Flashback: the champagne corks pops.
SHERLOCK
Delayed action stabbing. All the 
time in the world for an alibi.
In the room, Sholto is standing at the mirror, inspecting 
himself in his uniform.
SHOLTO
So. I was to be killed by my 
uniform. How appropriate.
MARY
He solved the case, Major. You’re 
supposed to open the door now - 
deal’s a deal.
But Sholto, still staring at himself, so haunted.
SHOLTO
Not even supposed to have this any 
more - they gave me special 
dispensation to keep it. Couldn’t 
imagine life out of this uniform. I 
suppose, in the circumstances, I 
don’t have to.
He starts to undo the uniform.
SHOLTO (CONT’D)
When so many want you dead, it’s 
hardly good manners to argue.
JOHN
Whatever you’re doing in there, 
stop it now. I will kick this door 
down.
SHOLTO
Mr. Holmes, you and I are similar, 
I think.

SHERLOCK
I think so too.
SHOLTO
There is a proper time to die, 
isn’t there?
SHERLOCK
Of course there is.
SHOLTO
And one should embrace it when it 
comes. Like a soldier.
SHERLOCK
Of course one should. But not at 
John’s wedding. We would never do 
that, would we, you and I. We’d 
never do that to John Watson.
On Sholto - hesitating.
Outside, the others react to the silence.
JOHN
Okay, I’m kicking the door in...
Mary gently pulls him back.
MARY
You won’t have to.
The sound of the key in the lock. Sholto opens the door, 
every inch the brave soldier.
SHOLTO
I believe I need medical attention.
He looks to Sherlock. A formal nod of gratitude.
JOHN
I believe I’m your doctor.

Sherlock and Janine are dancing together - formally but 
beautifully, a waltz. Sherlock is tutoring her.
SHERLOCK
And round ... and down ... and up, 
very good, just keep your nerve on 
the turns ...
JANINE
Why do we have to rehearse?
SHERLOCK
Because we’re about to dance 
together in public. And your skills 
are appalling.
JANINE
You’re a good teacher. You’re a 
brilliant dancer.
SHERLOCK
Can I let you into a secret, 
Janine?
JANINE
Go on then.
SHERLOCK
I love dancing. I’ve always loved 
it.
JANINE
Seriously?
He detaches for a moment, does an immaculate pirouette.
SHERLOCK
Never really comes up in crime work 
- I live in hope of the right case.
Janine, marveling at him.
JANINE
Oh, I wish you weren’t - whatever 
it is you are.
SHERLOCK
I know.
John has appeared from the pair.
JOHN
Oh, well, glad you’ve pulled, 
Sherlock, what with murderers 
running riot at my wedding.

SHERLOCK
One murderer. One nearly murderer. 
(To Janine)
Loves to exaggerate, you should try 
living with him.
LESTRADE
Sherlock!
They look round. Lestrade is arriving - coat on, clearly he’s 
been out. Following him, reluctantly, is the wedding 
photographer.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
Got him for you.
SHERLOCK
Excellent, the photographer, 
thankyou. Can I see your camera?
A little bewildered, the photographer proffers it.
PHOTOGRAPHER
What’s this about? I was half-way 
home.
SHERLOCK
You should’ve driven faster.
Sherlock has taken the camera. Is now flipping through the 
photos in it. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Ah, yes! Yes, very good. There, you 
see, perfect.
LESTRADE
What is? Are you going to tell us??
Sherlock tosses the camera to Lestrade.
SHERLOCK
Take a look yourself.
John and Lestrade, now flicking through the pictures. 
Sherlock moves away, taking up position behind the 
photographer, quite casually.
JOHN
A look for what? Is the murderer in 
the photos?
SHERLOCK
It’s not what’s in the photographs. 
It’s what’s in none of them. None 
of them at all.

we’ve discussed it before ...

There’s one man at a wedding, who 
is never in any photograph, but can 
go anywhere. Even carry an 
equipment bag, if he wants. And you 
never even see his face, you only 
ever see -

We see him properly at last, a handsome young man, SMALL. He 
looks wildly round. 
PHOTOGRAPHER

Sherlock, his smartphone in front of him.

SHERLOCK
Johnny Small. Today’s substitute 
photographer, known to us as the 
Mayfly Man. His brother was one of 
the ones killed in that friendly 
fire incident. Johnny wanted 
revenge on Sholto. So he worked his 
way through Sholto’s staff and 
found what he needed. Brilliant, 
ruthless, almost certainly a mono-
maniac. In fairness, though, his 
photographs are actually quite 
good. 
He hands his phone to Lestrade.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
All the information you need is 
there - you probably ought to 
arrest him or something.
JANINE
Do you always carry handcuffs?
SHERLOCK
Down girl!
The photographer, now glowering at Sherlock.
PHOTOGRAPHER
It’s not me you should be 
arresting, Mr. Holmes.
SHERLOCK
Oh, I don’t do the arresting, I 
farm that out. 
PHOTOGRAPHER
Sholto, he’s the killer. Not me. 
Not me.
Mary appears from the big room.
MARY
Guys, it’s almost time for -
She comes to a halt, seeing what’s happening.
PHOTOGRAPHER
I should’ve killed him quicker. I 
shouldn’t have tried to be clever.
Sherlock fixes the Photographer with a cold look.

You should’ve driven faster.

JOHN and MARY - first dance. It’s an achingly beautiful 
waltz. Charming, old-fashioned with a hint of melancholy. 
They’re surrounded by a circle of their friends, smiling and 
taking photos.
Pan up to the stage.
The solo violinist playing the tune for them is SHERLOCK. It 
comes to an end. Sherlock finishes with a flourish. 
Applause. The married couple take a bow.
Sherlock takes a bow.
Janine, whooping and hollering, like she’s at a rock concert.
Sherlock winks at her, tosses her the flower from his 
buttonhole.
Now he’s crossing to the microphone.
SHERLOCK
Ladies and gentlemen. One last 
thing, before the evening begins 
properly. Apologies for earlier. A 
crisis arose, and was dealt with. 
More importantly, though, today we 
saw two people make vows. I’ve 
never made a vow in my life. After 
today I never will again. So here, 
in front of you all, is my first 
and last vow. John and Mary. 
Whatever it takes, whatever happens 
from this day on - I swear I will 
always be there. Always. For -
He blinks - another brain crash.
Thoom!! Mary eating canapes like mad. 
Thoom!! Mary, grimaces at the taste of the wine.

The room - bemused.

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Sorry. Two of you. All two of you. 
Both of you, in fact. I just ... 
miscounted.
On John and Mary - the implications slowly hitting home. 
What? What?? 
Mary’s hand falters to her tummy - snatches it away again. A 
give-away!
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Okay, anyway, time for dancing. 
Could we have some music please. 
Could we start up the music again? 
Thankyou!
The music starts up. Tentatively, couples start moving on the 
floor. In the middle of the dance floor, John and Mary rooted 
to the spot, staring at Sherlock.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Come on now. Don’t be shy, 
everybody dancing please!
He abandons the microphone, jumps down from the stage (?) and 
heads through the dancing couples to where a stricken John 
and Mary are waiting for him.
John, Sherlock, Mary, all staring at each other, all a bit 
shell-shocked for different reasons. The dancers swirl around 
- a last quiet moment for the three of them, in the eye of
the storm.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Sorry. There was one more deduction 
there than I was really  expecting.
MARY
Deduction?
SHERLOCK
Changed taste perception, increased 
appetite. You were sick this 
morning, too. Caught a whiff of 
vomit when I kissed you earlier - 
remember you were cross when I 
mentioned it? All the signs are 
there.
MARY
The signs?
SHERLOCK
The signs of three. Mary, I think 
you should probably do a pregnancy 
test.

Sherlock reaches and gently takes Mary’s wineglass. No more 
of that.
A literally pregnant pause. The dancers swirl around them.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Of course, the statistics on the 
first trimester ...
JOHN
Shut up. Just ... shut up.
SHERLOCK
Sorry.
JOHN
How could you notice, and I didn’t. 
I’m a bloody doctor.
SHERLOCK
It’s your day off.
JOHN
It’s your day off.
SHERLOCK
Stop panicking.
JOHN
I’m not panicking!!
MARY
I’m pregnant, I’m panicking!!
SHERLOCK
Well, don’t. You’ve not got a 
single thing to worry about, either 
of you.
JOHN
Oh, you’d know, of course. 
SHERLOCK
I would, yes. You’re already the 
best parents in the world - look at 
the practice you’ve put in. 
JOHN
What practice?
SHERLOCK
Don’t suppose you’ll be needing me 
any more - now you’ve got a real 
baby on the way.
They laugh at that, all three of them. A beat on Sherlock - 
his laugh falters, realising that’s true.

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Dance.
JOHN
I”m sorry.
SHERLOCK
Both of you, dance, off you go. We 
can’t just stand here, people will 
wonder what we’re talking about!
MARY
What about you?
JOHN
The three of us can’t dance. There 
are limits.
SHERLOCK
Yes. There are.
MARY
Well - come on then, husband.
She moves into his arms.
JOHN
Is this another waltz, yeah?
MARY
Yes! 
They’re moving away from Sherlock, waltzing away among the 
couples.
SHERLOCK
(Calling after them)
Don’t worry, Mary, I’ve been 
tutoring him.
JOHN
He has, you know - in Baker Street, 
with the curtains shut. Mrs. Hudson 
walked in on us - don’t know how 
all those rumours got started.
A last laugh between Sherlock and John -
- and then Mary and John are swallowed by the other dancing 
couples.

And there’s Sherlock, in the loneliest place on Earth - in 
the middle of a dance floor, no partner, all the couples 
swirling around him.
Awkward for a moment, adrift. Then sees -
Janine, across the floor, waving to him. He’s starting 
forwards, when he sees why she’s waving. The sci-fi comics 
fan he pointed out to her earlier, is right next to her - and 
now they’re starting to dance. She gives Sherlock a thumbs up 
behind her new boy’s back.
Sherlock smiles. Sorted! He was right as usual.
Looks round again. Still so adrift, still so out of his 
comfort zone. Awkwardly he makes him way among the dancers.
Now he’s at the stage again. He reaches up and takes the 
sheet music he was playing from earlier.
Closer on the manuscript paper. It’s handwritten. In the 
corner - Waltz for Mary and John, by Sherlock Holmes.
He folds the paper, now slips it into an envelope he’s taken 
from his pocket. The envelope is labeled, in Sherlock’s 
handwriting “Dr. and Mrs Watson”.
Passing one of the tables, he props the envelope against a 
wine bottle, where someone will find it.
Now glances round the dance floor again. A fleeting glimpse 
of Mary and John dancing among the other couples. Talking, 
rapt in each other laughing.
Now on Sherlock - heading briskly towards the exit.
EXT. HOTEL. NIGHT.

Coat on, Sherlock comes down the steps, and heads away into 
the night.
Takes a breath. Looks around. Heads on.
On Sherlock Holmes, in the moonlight, walking away. Alone 
again.
