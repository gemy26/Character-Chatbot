FADE UP FROM BLACK:
EXT. DARTMOOR. WOODS. DAY. 1991.

1
Early morning. 
A wooded copse formed from strange, gnarled trees and 
tumbled rocks. 
Wandering out of it, lost and alone, is seven year old 
HENRY. 
He’s bewildered, shocked, wide-eyed. Dressed for a hike but 
his clothes are muddied and disarranged. 
We cut with violent speed to --
CUT TO:
EXT. DARTMOOR. HOLLOW. NIGHT 1991.

ECU:
Bloodied hands.
The snarling mouth of a huge wolf-like creature. 
Dark human eyes, wild and terrified.

Young HENRY wanders on, his face is blank and 
expressionless.
FAST CUT TO:

Through the fog and in the stuttering beam of a torch, we 
can just make out a well-built man in his 20s, CHARLIE, 
fending off a savage attack. 
Snatched, horrible images. 
Fur.
Claws.
Teeth. 
The steam of the beast’s breath. 
Charlie’s fists smashing at it --


-- and little HENRY, hidden beneath an outcrop of boulders, 
watching in petrified silence. 
CUT TO:
EXT. DARTMOOR. TOR. DAY. 1991.

An elderly woman, GRACE, is walking her dog. It’s on a long 
lead, snuffling around on a dramatic, rocky tor. Suddenly 
its ears prick up as HENRY wanders down off the moor like a 
ghost.
Grace notices. 
GRACE
Oh. Hello. 
(frowns)
Are you alright?
Henry just stares at her.

Snatched shots:
Razor sharp teeth. Dripping with blood. 
CHARLIE curling into a ball as the thing pounces for him --
GRACE (V.O.)
What is it, dear?

GRACE is staring down at HENRY, deeply concerned. 
GRACE
Are you lost?
Henry blinks and glances over at Grace’s friendly-looking 
dog. 
Then he SCREAMS!
We close in on his horrified face -- screaming, screaming, 
screaming!

EXT. DARTMOOR. HOLLOW. DAY. 
7A
7A
HENRY, twenty years older, is standing in the hollow, staring 
into the darkness. Fog drifts and billows  around him. 
He’s deep in thought. His head snaps round. He’s suddenly 
scared. Is there something out there? 
He turns on his heel and goes. 
CUT TO:
TITLES.

CLOSE on a ‘nodding dog’ toy. It’s in the window of 
‘Speedy’s’ cafe. The dog starts madly nodding as a door 
slams (someone entering 221b!)
CUT TO:
INT. BAKER ST. DAY.

The flat door flies open, revealing -
- SHERLOCK, blood spattered, carrying a harpoon.
SHERLOCK
Well that was tedious!
Now we see JOHN in his armchair, staring at him.
JOHN
You went on the tube like that?
CUT TO:
INT. BAKER ST. DAY.
10A
10A
SHERLOCK, now cleaned up and in his dressing gown, pacing, 
agitated, still carrying the harpoon, gesticulating with 
it.
JOHN’s in his chair, surrounded by a litter of newspapers 
and the remains of breakfast.
SHERLOCK
Nothing?
JOHN
Military coup in Uganda. 
(smiles)
Another photo of you in the...um -
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  3.


In the paper, we see a picture of Sherlock wearing the 
deerstalker.
Sherlock groans. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
Cabinet re-shuffle -
SHERLOCK
Nothing of interest, I mean! Oh 
God. 
He manically bangs the end of the harpoon off the floor. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
John, I need some. Get me some! 
JOHN
No.
SHERLOCK
Get me some!
JOHN
No! Cold turkey. We agreed. No 
matter what. 
Beat.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Anyway, you’ve paid everyone off, 
remember? No-one within a two 
mile radius will sell you any! 
SHERLOCK
Stupid idea! Whose idea was that? 
JOHN
Yours.
SHERLOCK
(yells)
Mrs Hudson! 
He lays the harpoon aside and starts rooting through the 
bric-a-brac of the flat, flinging books, magazines, laptops
over his shoulder.
JOHN
You’re doing really well. Don’t 
give in now.
SHERLOCK
Tell me where they are. Please. 
Tell me. Pleeeease.
JOHN
(steely)
I can’t help you. Sorry. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  4.


SHERLOCK
I’ll let you know next week’s 
lottery numbers. 
A sceptical look from John. Sherlock crumbles. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Worth a try. 
He narrows his eyes - then pounces on an old, curly-toed 
Persian slipper tucked away near the fireplace. With a cry 
of triumph, he burrows his hand inside -- but it’s empty. 
He hurls it disgustedly across the room. 
MRS HUDSON pops her head round the door. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(without looking round)
I had an emergency packet. What 
have you done with my emergency 
packet?!
MRS HUDSON
Eh?
SHERLOCK
Cigarettes! Where’ve you hidden 
them? I know you’ve got them 
somewhere.
Mrs Hudson glances quickly at John. He shakes his head -- 
shh!
MRS HUDSON
You know you never let me touch 
your things. Chance’d be a fine 
thing. 
SHERLOCK
(sharp)
I thought you weren’t my 
housekeeper?
MRS HUDSON
(thrown)
I’m not -
John throws an appealing look at her.
MRS HUDSON (CONT’D)
How about a nice cuppa? And 
perhaps you could put away your 
harpoon.
SHERLOCK
I need something stronger than 
tea. 
(sotto)
Maybe seven per cent stronger.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  5.


Sherlock spins round and looks Mrs Hudson up and down, 
forensically and not a little cruelly. He picks up the 
harpoon and points it accusingly at her.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
You’ve been to see Mr Chatterjee
again.
MRS HUDSON
Pardon?
SHERLOCK
In the sandwich shop. You’re 
wearing a new dress but there’s 
flour on your sleeve. You’d never 
wear that for baking -
JOHN
Sherlock...
Sherlock points the harpoon at Mrs Hudson’s hands. 
SHERLOCK
Thumbnail. Little traces of foil. 
Playing the scratch-cards again? 
We all know where that leads, 
don’t we?
(sniffs)
And ‘Casbah Nights’. Pretty racy 
for first thing on a Monday 
morning, isn’t it? I’ve written a 
little blog about the 
identification of perfumes. It’s 
on the website. You should look 
it up! 
MRS HUDSON
Please -
SHERLOCK
I wouldn’t pin your hopes on that 
cruise with Mr Chatterjee. He’s 
got a wife in Doncaster that 
nobody knows about. 
JOHN
Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
Well, nobody except me. 
MRS HUDSON
I don’t know what you’re talking 
about. Really, I don’t. 
She marches out, on the verge of tears. Slams the door.
JOHN
What the hell was all that about? 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  6.


SHERLOCK
You don’t understand. Of course 
you don’t. 
JOHN
Go after her. Go and apologise.
SHERLOCK
Apologise?
He throws down the harpoon and flops into his chair, hugging 
his knees to his chin.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I envy you so much, John.
JOHN
You envy me?
SHERLOCK
Your mind. It’s so placid! So 
straightforward. Barely used.
A look from John. Cheers.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Mine’s like an engine. Racing. Out 
of control. A rocket, trapped on 
the launch pad, tearing itself to 
pieces. I need a case!!
JOHN
You’ve just solved one! By 
harpooning a dead pig, apparently! 
SHERLOCK
That was this morning. Where’s the 
next one??
JOHN
Nothing on the website?
Sherlock grabs an open laptop and shoves it at John. 
SHERLOCK
“Dear Sherlock Holmes. I can’t 
find Bluebell anywhere. Please, 
please, please can you help?”
JOHN
Bluebell?  
SHERLOCK
A rabbit, John. 
JOHN
Oh.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  7.


SHERLOCK
Ah, but there’s more! Before it 
disappeared, Bluebell turned 
luminous! Like a fairy - according 
to little Kirsty. Then the next 
morning, Bluebell was gone, hutch 
still locked, no sign of forced 
entry - what am I say this is 
brilliant!
(Grabs laptop)
Phone Lestrade, tell him there’s an 
escaped rabbit!
JOHN
You’re kidding.
SHERLOCK
It’s this or Cluedo.
JOHN
No. We’re never playing that 
again. 
SHERLOCK
Why not?
JOHN
Because it’s not actually 
possible for the victim to have 
done it, Sherlock, that’s why.  
SHERLOCK
I couldn’t see any other 
solution.
JOHN
It’s not in the rules! 
SHERLOCK
Then the rule are wrong!  
The doorbell downstairs buzzes. Sherlock and John look at 
each other, suddenly.
JOHN
Single ring!
SHERLOCK
Maximum pressure, just under the 
half-second!
Big grins!
SHERLOCK & JOHN
Client!!

TV FOOTAGE.
11
11
Stock footage of Dartmoor. Bleak. Wild. Wind howls. 
PRESENTER V/O
Dartmoor. It’s always been a 
place of myth and legend. But is 
there something else lurking out 
there? Something very real? 
Shaky, hand-held, drive by shots of a grim-looking military 
compound. ‘Keep Out’ signs and barbed wire everywhere.
PRESENTER V/O (CONT’D)
Because Dartmoor is also home to 
one of the Government’s most 
secretive operations. The chemical 
and biological weapons research 
centre that’s said to be even more 
sensitive than Porton Down. Since 
the end of the second  world war, 
there have been persistent stories 
about the Baskerville experiments.
Close on a battered, tree-screened M.O.D. sign: 
BASKERVILLE. 
Now (if possible) on hillside with the military compound 
visible beyond him.
PRESENTER 
Genetic mutations. Animals grown 
for the battlefield. There are 
many who believe that within this 
compound, in the heart of this 
ancient wilderness, there are 
horrors beyond imagining ... 
Closer on the presenter now - dramatic emphasis.
PRESENTER (CONT’D)
... but the real question is, are 
all of them still inside?
The documentary now cuts to Henry, sitting in his messy front 
door. Shaking - neurotic but determined, a man recalling 
terrible memories. As he speaks, a caption comes up:
HENRY KNIGHT
HENRY
I was just a kid. It was on the 
moor, it was dark, but I know what 
I saw. I know what killed my 
father.
And the image freezes.

INT. BAKER STREET. DAY.
12
12
-- on the TV in Baker Street. 
SHERLOCK has the remote. 
SHERLOCK
What did you see?
There’s a newcomer in the sitting room - HENRY KNIGHT (20s, 
nervy) the man from the documentary. He points, slightly 
feebly, at the screen.
HENRY
I was just about to say.
SHERLOCK
Yes, in a TV interview. I prefer to 
do my own editing.
He snaps the television off.
HENRY
Yes. Sorry, yes, of course.
He takes out a scrunched up paper napkin and rubs his nose, 
dislodging all kinds of rubbish from his pocket. He stuffs 
the napkin away.
JOHN
In your own time.
SHERLOCK
But quite quickly.
HENRY
Do you know Dartmoor, Mr. Holmes?
SHERLOCK
No.
HENRY
It’s an amazing place. Like nowhere 
else - sort of bleak but beautiful -
SHERLOCK
Yes, don’t care, moving on.
HENRY
We used to go for walks - after my 
Mum died, my Dad and me, every 
evening we’d go out on the moor-
SHERLOCK
Yes, good, skipping on to the night 
he was violently killed - where did 
it happen? 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  10.


HENRY
There’s a place - a sort of local 
landmark - called Dewer’s Hollow. 
(A beat - grim)
That’s an ancient name for the 
devil.
SHERLOCK
So?
Henry flusters in the face of Sherlock’s indifference.
JOHN
Did you see the devil that night?
HENRY
... yes.
CUT TO:
FLASHBACK
Expressionistic flashes. Red eyes! Snapping jaws! Muscle and 
fur! A man thrashing under a savage attack. Now blood 
spattering across the screen and --
CUT TO:
Henry, shaken at the memory.
HENRY
It got him. Tore at him. Tore his 
throat out. 
(shrugs)
I can’t remember anything else. 
They found me the next morning. 
Just wandering on the moor. My 
Dad’s body was never found.
John looks at the notes he’s been taking.
JOHN
Red eyes. Coal black fur. Enormous.
(To Sherlock)
A dog? A wolf?
SHERLOCK
A genetic experiment?
Henry looks at him, sharply, catching something in his tone.
HENRY
Are you laughing at me, Mr. Holmes?
SHERLOCK
Why, are you joking?
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  11.


HENRY
My Dad was always going on about 
the things they were doing at 
Baskerville. What kind of 
monsters they might be breeding.
People used to laugh at him too. 
At least the TV people took me 
seriously.
SHERLOCK
And I’m sure did wonders for Devon 
tourism.
Colour now springing into Henry’s cheeks. What??
JOHN
Whatever happened to your father, 
it was twenty years ago. Why come 
to us now?
But Henry has already sprung to his feet.
HENRY
Not sure you can help me, Mr. 
Holmes - since you find it all so 
funny!
SHERLOCK
(Answering John)
Because of what happened last 
night. 
JOHN
... sorry, what? What happened last 
night?
Henry is staring at Sherlock now.
HENRY
How did you know?
SHERLOCK
I didn’t know - I noticed. You’ve 
come up from Devon by the first 
available train this morning. You 
had a disappointing breakfast and a 
cup of black coffee. A girl in the 
seat across the aisle fancied you 
but, although you were initially 
keen, you’ve now changed your mind. 
You are, though, extremely anxious 
to have your first cigarette of the 
day. Sit down, Mr Knight. And do 
please smoke. I’d be delighted. 
Unless you still think I can’t be 
of help to you?
Henry looks astonished. Then relapses back into his chair. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  12.


HENRY
How could you “notice” all that?
JOHN
He’ll tell you later. It’s not 
important --
Sherlock nods towards the floor. 
SHERLOCK
Punched-out holes from where your 
ticket’s been checked. 
JOHN
Not now, Sherlock. 
SHERLOCK
Oh go on. I’ve been cooped up in 
here for ages. 
JOHN
You’re just showing off.
SHERLOCK
Of course! I’m a show off! That’s 
what we do! 
He leans over and pulls out the paper napkin from Henry’s 
pocket. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Train napkin which you’ve used to 
mop up spilled coffee. Strength 
of the stain shows you didn’t 
take milk. There are traces of 
ketchup on it and round your lips 
and on your sleeve. Cooked 
breakfast. Or the nearest thing 
those trains can manage. Probably 
a sandwich. 
HENRY
How do you know it was... 
disappointing?
SHERLOCK
Is there any other kind of 
breakfast on a train? The girl -- 
female handwriting’s quite 
distinctive -- wrote down her 
phone number on the napkin. I can 
see from the angle she wrote at 
that she was sitting across from 
you on the other side of the 
aisle. Later - after she’d got 
off I imagine - you used the 
napkin to mop up your coffee and 
accidentally smudged the number. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  13.
(MORE)


You’ve gone over the last four 
digits yourself with another pen 
so you wanted to keep the number. 
Just a moment ago, though, you 
used the napkin to blow your 
nose. Maybe you’re not that into 
her after all. Then there’s the 
nicotine stains on your fingers. 
Your shaking fingers. I know the 
signs. No chance to smoke on the 
train, no time to roll one before 
you got the cab here. You’re 
desperate. It’s now a little 
after 9.15. The first train from 
Exeter to London is at 5.46 am. 
You got the first one possible so 
something important must’ve
happened last night. Am I wrong? 
Beat. 
HENRY
No. You’re right. You’re exactly 
right. Bloody hell. I heard you 
were quick. 
SHERLOCK
It’s my job. Now shut up and 
smoke!
Henry takes out a packet of Rizlas, rolls a cigarette and 
lights up. The smoke drifts. Sherlock, not so subtly, 
inhales. 
John shoots him a disapproving look, then turns to Henry. 
His approach is careful and gentle, full of genuine bedside 
manner. 
JOHN
(gently)
So you lost both parents. And you 
were only - what? - seven years 
old. It must’ve been quite a trauma 
...
HENRY
No -
JOHN
Have you thought maybe you invented 
this story, this ... big bad wolf, 
to account for it? 
HENRY
That’s what Dr. Mortimer says. 
JOHN
Who?
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  14.
SHERLOCK (CONT'D)


SHERLOCK
His therapist.
HENRY
My therapist.
SHERLOCK
Obviously!
HENRY
Louise Mortimer. She’s the reason I 
came back to Dartmoor. She thinks I 
have to ... face my demons. 
SHERLOCK
And when you returned to Scratch’s 
Hollow last night, what happened? 
You went there on the advice of a 
therapist, and now you’re 
consulting a detective - what did 
you see, that changed everything?
HENRY
... It’s a strange place, the 
Hollow - makes you feel so cold 
inside - so afraid -
SHERLOCK
If I wanted poetry, I’d read John’s 
emails to his girlfriends - much 
funnier. What did you see?
HENRY
Footprints. On the exact spot where 
I saw my father torn apart.
JOHN
A man’s or a woman’s.
HENRY
Neither.  They were -
SHERLOCK
Is that all? Anything else - 
footprints, is that it?
HENRY
Yes, but they were -
SHERLOCK
Sorry, Dr. Mortimer wins - it’s a 
childhood trauma masked by an 
invented memory. Boring. Goodbye, 
Mr. Knight - thankyou for smoking.
Sherlock is now striding through the back, as if to his 
bedroom.
HENRY
But what about the footprints?
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  15.


SHERLOCK
Paw-prints, I assume, Could be 
anything - therefore nothing. Off 
to Devon with you - have a cream 
tea on me.
Starts heading away again.
HENRY
Mr. Holmes ... they were the 
footprints of a gigantic hound!
On the back of Sherlock’s head as he jolts to a halt. Now 
turns slowly. Now he’s looking at Henry, now he’s interested.
SHERLOCK
Say that again.
HENRY
I found paw prints - they were big, 
they were - ...
SHERLOCK
No, no. Your exact words. Repeat 
your exact words from a moment ago, 
exactly as you said them.
On Henry. Puzzled, a little self-conscious. Exchanges a look 
with an equally bewildered John - who just nods. Do as he 
says.
HENRY
Mr. Holmes ... they were the 
footprints of a gigantic hound.
On Sherlock: eyes gleaming, mind whirling.
SHERLOCK
... I’ll take the case. 
JOHN
Sorry, what?
SHERLOCK
Thank you for bringing this to my 
attention, it’s very promising.
JOHN
No, sorry, what?? A minute ago 
footprints were boring, now they’ve 
very promising!
SHERLOCK
It’s nothing to do with the 
footprints. As ever, John, you 
weren’t listening. This place, 
Baskerville - ever heard of it?
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  16.


JOHN
Vaguely. Very hush-hush.
SHERLOCK
Sounds like a good place to 
start. 
HENRY
You’ll come down then? 
Beat. Sherlock looks at John.
SHERLOCK
No, I can’t leave London at the 
moment, far too busy. But don’t 
worry, I’m sending my best man.
(Claps John on the 
shoulder)
I know I can rely on John to send 
me all the relevant data as he 
never understands a word of it 
himself.
JOHN
What’re you talking about, you‘re 
too busy?? You haven’t got any 
cases! You were just complaining - 
SHERLOCK
Bluebell. I’ve got Bluebell. The 
case of the vanishing glow-in-the-
dark rabbit. 
(To Henry)
NATO is in uproar.
HENRY
Sorry. You’re not coming then?
Oh John - resigned, getting it.
JOHN
Okay. Okay.
John sighs hugely, goes over to the mantelpiece, lifts up 
the skull and retrieves Sherlock’s emergency packet of 
cigarettes. He tosses them over. 
Sherlock catches them, laughs and chucks them over his 
shoulder.
SHERLOCK
Don’t need ‘em any more, I’m going 
to Dartmoor.
HENRY
Sorry - you are coming?

SHERLOCK
A twenty year old disappearance! 
A monster Hound! I wouldn’t miss 
this for the world!

SHERLOCK is holding open the door of a cab as JOHN comes 
out of 221b with their bags. 
They both turn at the sound of raised voices from Speedy’s 
sandwich shop. 
A floury bap slams against the window.
JOHN
I guess Mrs Hudson just got to 
the wife in Doncaster. 
SHERLOCK
Wait till she finds out about the 
one in Islamabad. 
He ducks into the taxi, gets out his phone.
Zoom into the screen of the phone.
Staggered, Google-Earth stills of an English village. 
On-screen text: Grimpen, Dartmoor. 
The stills jerk past in procession, opening out onto --
CUT TO:
EXT. DARTMOOR. DAY.

-- the vast, bleak moor, in photographic form.
This scrolls by to show a sprawling complex of brick 
buildings ringed by a huge wire fence --

-- Baskerville. 
The photo becomes the present day.
The perimeter of the base is bristling with barbed wire and 
armed soldiers.
There’s a big sign: BASKERVILLE. AUTHORISED PERSONNEL ONLY. 
DANGER AREA!
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  18.


The cloudy sky lowers over the base like a bruise.
There are double gates and a landrover has pulled up at the 
check-point.

SHERLOCK’s driving. JOHN’s in the passenger seat. 
Sherlock looks out. Details: heavily armed soldiers, guard 
dogs, masses of security cameras. 
Sherlock’s window glides down with an electronic hum. He 
proffers a laminated ID card to a uniformed MILITARY 
POLICEMAN who takes it, frowning and crosses to his hut. 
JOHN
You’ve got ID for Baskerville? 
How?
SHERLOCK
It’s not specific to this place. 
It’s my brother’s. Sort of 
‘access all areas’. I...acquired
it. Ages ago. Just in case. 
JOHN
Oh brilliant. 
SHERLOCK
What’s the matter?
JOHN
We’ll get caught.
SHERLOCK
No, we won’t. Not for a bit.
JOHN
Caught in five minutes. ‘Hello! We 
just thought we’d have a wander 
round your top secret weapons 
base’. ‘Oh yeah? Great! Come in. 
Kettle’s just boiled’. 
Beat.
JOHN (CONT’D)
That’s if we don’t get shot. 
SHERLOCK
Well that’s not a problem. We’ll 
almost certainly get shot at some 
point.

CLOSE on the ID card. A complicated bar-code and a 
signature: Mycroft Holmes.
The MILITARY POLICEMAN swipes it through a reader -beep! -
then hands it back to Sherlock and waves the landrover 
through.

JOHN puts the car in gear. 
JOHN
Mycroft’s name literally opens 
doors.
SHERLOCK
I’ve told you. He practically is 
the British Government. 
Right. I reckon we’ve got twenty 
minutes until they find out 
something’s wrong!
He puts his foot down, the landrover roars ahead. 
CUT TO:
EXT. BASKERVILLE. COMPOUND. DAY.

JOHN screeches the landrover to a halt in a concrete 
compound. There are army trucks and civilian cars 
everywhere along with huge, mysterious pipes and metal 
tanks. 
A uniformed Corporal, LYONS (20s, small, trim) darts from 
the brick entrance-way to meet them. 
LYONS
What is it? Are we in trouble?
SHERLOCK
Are we in trouble, sir.
Lyons comes to attention.
LYONS
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
SHERLOCK
You were expecting us? 
LYONS

Security. Is there something 
wrong, sir?
SHERLOCK
I hope not, Corporal. I hope not.
LYONS
We don’t get inspected, you see, 
sir. It just doesn’t happen. 
JOHN
Never heard of a spot check?
Lyons looks questioningly at John who pulls out his own 
army ID.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Captain John Watson. Fifth 
Northumberland Fusiliers.
Lyons snaps to attention and salutes. John reciprocates.
LYONS
Sir!
LYONS (CONT’D)
(squirming)
Major Barrymore won’t be pleased, 
sir. He’ll want to see you both. 
Immediately.
JOHN
I’m afraid we don’t have time for 
that. We need the full tour. 
Right now. Carry on. 
Lyons hesitates. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
That’s an order, Corporal. 
LYONS
Yes, sir. 
Lyons leads them through into the glass portico.
Sherlock checks his watch.
Lyons swipes his card through another reader - beep!
Sherlock swipes his fake card - beep! 
And we zoom into the guts of the ID reader. The screen 
immediately crowds with a matrix-like scree of data.
A trail of golden numbers seem to follow Sherlock, John and 
Lyons as they head into the base.

LYONS leads them down a brick corridor.
SHERLOCK

Nice touch.
JOHN
Haven’t pulled rank in ages. 
SHERLOCK
Enjoy it?
JOHN

Oh yes.
Lyons leads them into an elevator. As the doors close, 
SHERLOCK notices the number of buttons. The base obviously 
goes a long way down...

The lift doors open onto a spartan, modern lab set-up. A 
contrast to the old brick walls. Stark white light 
alternates with pools of a sort of underwater green. 
CLOSE on a shrieking, caged chimp, rattling the bars of its 
prison. 
Masked and gowned SCIENTISTS are at work-stations, busy on 
innumerable and unknown experiments. A few glance round as 
the strangers walk past.  
The scientists all seem equally blank and unknown. Their 
masks rendering them chillingly identical.  
In cages all over the place are rats, mice, monkeys ... and
dogs. 
SHERLOCK
How many animals do you keep down 
here?
LYONS
Lots. 
SHERLOCK
Any of them ever get out?
LYONS
(smiles)
They’d have to know how to get 
through that door, sir. And we’re 
not breeding them that clever.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  22.


SHERLOCK
Unless they have help?
Lyons doesn’t respond. 
There’s a door close by with a home-made cardboard sign on 
it. In cheery writing it says “Keep Out - unless you want a 
cold!!”
Through a window in the door, we see a figure in gas mask and 
protective suit getting out of his gear. 
JOHN
What exactly do you do in here?
LYONS
I thought you’d know. This being 
an inspection. Sir.
JOHN
(cold)
Yes. But I’m not an expert. Am I?
Lyons is stung by this. Tries to make amends. 
LYONS
Everything from stem cell 
research to trying to cure the 
common cold, sir.
JOHN
But mostly weaponry? 
LYONS
Of one sort or another.
JOHN
Biological, chemical...
LYONS
One war ends. Another one begins, 
sir. New enemies to fight. We 
have to be prepared. 
The airlock door opens with a hiss, revealing DR FRANKLAND 
(50s, breezy).
FRANKLAND
Can I help?
LYONS
That’s ok, Dr Frankland. Just 
showing these gentlemen around. 
FRANKLAND
Oh. New faces! How nice. Careful 
you don’t get stuck here, though. 
I only came to fix a tap.  
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  23.


He smiles then passes them, walking to the lift. He jabs 
his finger at the button. 
Close to them is an enclosed area made up of plastic strips. 
Through it we can see shadowy figures at work on who-knows-
what.
JOHN
(nodding to the lift)
How far down does that go?
LYONS
Quite a way.
Frankland gets into the lift and the doors close over his 
face. As they do, he narrows his eyes at Sherlock. Does he 
recognise him? 
JOHN
And what’s down there?
LYONS
(shrugs)
We have to keep the bins 
somewhere, sir. This way, please.
Sherlock looks at his watch again. 
Lyons and Sherlock swipe their cards again. Beep! - beep! 
The golden trail of numbers suddenly branches out like a

A long, dimly-lit corridor. Antiseptic in its starkness. 
LYONS appears, SHERLOCK and JOHN following close behind. 
JOHN
Get out much, do you? From 
Baskerville, I mean?
LYONS
Not really, sir. It’s a bit like 
doing a tour of duty on a sub. We 
rarely come up for air. There’s a
mess room where we’re meant to 
unwind. But you can only watch 
‘The Lion King’ so many times, 
you know.
They pass a door. Sherlock peers through the round glass 
panel inset in it. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  24.


Sherlock’s POV: Another white-coated scientist is by a 
glass tank. He’s wearing a surgical mask.  The room is 
bleach-white. Microscopes, computer screens everywhere.  
The golden tracery of numbers splits the screen into two, 
following the path of a phone line. 
We stay with Sherlock, John and Lyons on one side of the 
screen. In the other, a WOMAN, seen only from behind, picks 
up a phone.

Beep! Beep! 
SHERLOCK, JOHN, LYONS enter another lab. It’s a big white 
room studded with small amber coloured windows. There’s a 
long row of sheeted rectangular shapes along one wall and a 
smaller room towards the back. It’s labelled ‘Clean Room’. 
An experiment is coming to an end. One wall is like a huge 
light box. A sandy-haired woman - JACQUI STAPLETON (40s, 
hard) - is standing behind a lab monkey. The creature’s 
head is festooned with electrodes. It reaches out its paw 
for some food and a bell rings. Correct response. The wall 
lights up green with a huge luminous white circle.
AS they watch, Stapleton adjusts a dial and the monkey 
reaches out for more food. Incorrect response. The light-wall 
turns red with white crosses. An ASSISTANT stands to one 
side.
STAPLETON
Ok, Tim. We’ll try Harlow 3 next 
time - 
She catches sight of the newcomers. An ASSISTANT leads the 
monkey away. 
LYONS
Dr Stapleton -
SHERLOCK
(alert)
Stapleton? 
STAPLETON
Yes. Who’s this?
LYONS
Priority ultra, Ma’am. Orders 
from on high. An inspection.
STAPLETON
Really?
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  25.


SHERLOCK
We’re to be accorded every 
courtesy, Dr Stapleton. What’s 
your role at Baskerville?
She laughs contemptuously. 
JOHN
Accorded ever courtesy, wasn’t 
that the idea?
STAPLETON
I’m not free to say. Official 
Secrets. 
SHERLOCK
Oh, you most certainly are free. 
And I suggest you remain that way.
A beat on Stapleton - registering the threat.
STAPLETON
I have a lot of fingers in a lot 
of pies. I like to mix things up. 
Genes, mostly. Now and then, 
actual fingers.
SHERLOCK
Stapleton - I know the name.
STAPLETON
I doubt it.
Sherlock takes out a notebook and hastily scribbles down 
something. 
SHERLOCK
People say there’s no such thing as 
coincidence - what dull lives they 
must have.
He holds up the note. It says: BLUEBELL.
STAPLETON
Have you been talking to my 
daughter?
SHERLOCK
Why did Bluebell have to die, Dr.
Stapleton?
JOHN
The rabbit?
SHERLOCK
Disappeared from inside a locked 
hutch. Which was always 
suggestive.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  26.


JOHN
The rabbit?
SHERLOCK
Clearly an inside job. 
STAPLETON
Oh, you reckon?
SHERLOCK
Why? Because it glowed in the 
dark? 
STAPLETON
I have absolutely no idea what 
you’re talking about. Who are 
you?
SHERLOCK
(checks watch)
Well, I think we’ve seen enough 
for now, Corporal. Thank you so 
much. 
LYONS
That’s it?
SHERLOCK
That’s it. 
STAPLETON
Just a minute!
SHERLOCK
It’s this way, isn’t it?
JOHN
(Catching up with him - 
sotto)
Have we broken into a military base 
to investigate a rabbit??
Sherlock swipes his ID through the door reader.
Beep! 
The golden tracery of numbers splits the screen into four.

SHERLOCK and JOHN step past him into the corridor and walk 
swiftly towards the exit. Barrymore races after them. 
FRANKLAND and LYONS bring up the rear.
JOHN
Major Barrymore, is it? Yes. 
Well. Good. Very good. We’re very 
impressed. Aren’t we, Mr Holmes?
SHERLOCK
Deeply. Hugely.

His phone buzzes again. 
On-screen text: What’s going on, Sherlock? 
BARRYMORE
The whole point of Baskerville
was to eliminate this kind of 
bureaucratic nonsense! 
SHERLOCK

I’m so sorry, Major -- 
BARRYMORE
Inspections!
SHERLOCK

Goodness knows what you’d get up

Keep walking. 
Suddenly a klaxon shrieks!
Lyons races up to them, phone in hand. 
LYONS
Sir! ID unauthorised, sir! 
JOHN
What?
LYONS
Just had the call.
BARRYMORE
(pleased)
Is that right?
He slams his hand against a button on the wall and the door 
in front of them seals with a hiss. 
Sherlock and John are trapped. Sherlock is totally calm.
BARRYMORE (CONT’D)
Who are you?
JOHN
Look, there’s obviously been some 
kind of mistake -
Barrymore holds out his hand, Sherlock gives him the ID 
Card. 
BARRYMORE
Clearly not Mycroft Holmes.

FRANKLAND (O.S.)
It’s alright, Major. I know 
exactly who these gentlemen are.
They turn. FRANKLAND has appeared from behind. 
BARRYMORE
You do?
FRANKLAND
Getting slow on faces - but Mr.
Holmes isn’t someone I expected to 
show up in this place. 
He’s approaching. On Sherlock - bracing himself for rapid-
fire explanation.
SHERLOCK
Ah! Well!
FRANKLAND
Good to see you again, Mycroft.

I had the honour of meeting Mr

Brussels, wasn’t it?
SHERLOCK

FRANKLAND
That’s right. 
He smiles pleasantly at Barrymore. 
FRANKLAND (CONT’D)
This is Mr Mycroft Holmes, Major. 
There’s obviously been a mistake.
Barrymore looks them glacially up and down. 
BARRYMORE

Sherlock doesn’t answer. 
FRANKLAND (CONT’D)
Thought so. I knew he wanted to get

Sherlock Holmes. Oh I know who you 
really are. Never off that website!
Thought you’d be wearing the hat.

FRANKLAND (CONT’D)
Look, I can’t talk now. Here’s my

If I can help, with Henry, give me

SHERLOCK
I never asked, Dr Frankland. What 
is it you do up here, exactly? 
FRANKLAND

Well, you know, I’d love to tell 
you but then I’d have to kill 
you.
SHERLOCK
That would be tremendously 
ambitious of you. Tell me about Dr. 
Stapleton.
FRANKLAND
I never speak ill of a colleague.
SHERLOCK
But you’d speak well of one. Which 
you are clearly omitting to do.
FRANKLAND

Probably a fluorescent gene. 
Removed and spliced into the

JOHN
So?
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  33.


SHERLOCK
So we know Dr. Stapleton performs

There’s Baskerville. 
We can just make out some of the brick buildings, partially

And Grimpen village. That must be

He looks over onto the moor where’s there’s a separate 
little wooded area. Sherlock takes out some binoculars. 
Sherlock’s POV: There’s a big, fenced off area in front of 
Baskerville.
SHERLOCK
What’s that?
He hands the binoculars to John. John looks, then checks 
with the map. We see that around the rectangular shapes of 
the base is a large shaded area marked with a skull and 
crossbones. 
JOHN

Minefield, maybe.

A huge, snarling wolf’s head thrusts straight towards 
camera --

chic). A group of TOURISTS in walking gear are flocked 
round him in the pleasant village of Grimpen. Plenty of new 
housing and a veggie gastro-pub: The Cross Keys. The moor 
is visible through gaps in the twisty streets
One of the tourists shrieks delightedly, and then laughs as 
Fletcher removes the wolf’s head. 
FLETCHER
Gotcha! Hope you’ve enjoyed 
yourselves, anyway, ladies and 
gents! If you’re with a loved 
one, I hope you held their hand. 
If you’re on your own, I hope 
this was an opportunity to make

More laughter. 
FLETCHER (CONT’D)
Three tours a day. Tell your

Don’t be strangers and remember, 
stay away from the moor at night! 
If you value your lives! 
He howls like a wolf. Lots of laughter. The crowd disperse, 
leaving SHERLOCK and JOHN watching. Fletcher packs up his 
things including a big, home-made sign: a scary-looking 
woodcut of a savage dog and, in writing dripping with black

Not just explosives. Break into

Sherlock’s ears prick up at this. As he watches, Fletcher’s

That’s handy. For trade. 
A slim, younger man - BILLY - crosses from the kitchen.
GARY
Just saying, we’ve been rushed

BILLY
Yes. Lots of monster hunters. 
Doesn’t take much these days. One

No. Nothing like that. Just

Well, you’re gonna lose your

We see: a blurred ,flash-lit image of some kind of huge 
dog. It’s running. And fog obscures most of it. Fletcher 
scrolls through a few more similar photos. 
Sherlock snorts.
SHERLOCK
Is that it? Hardly proof. Sorry, 
John. I win. 
He turns to go. 
FLETCHER
Wait, wait! That’s not all. 
People don’t like going up there, 
you know. To the hollow. Gives 
them a...bad sort of feeling. 
SHERLOCK
Ooh. Haunted? Is that supposed to 
convince me? 
FLETCHER
Nah. Don’t be stupid. Nothing 
like that. But I reckon there is 
something out there. Something 
from Baskerville. Escaped. 
SHERLOCK
What? A clone? A super-dog?
FLETCHER
Maybe. God knows what they’ve 
been spraying on us all these 
years. Or putting in the water. I 
wouldn’t trust them as far as I 
could spit. 
SHERLOCK
Is that the best you’ve got? 
Fletcher undoes his rucksack. As he does so, he leans 
conspiratorially towards John and Sherlock.  
FLETCHER
I had a mate once who worked for 
the MOD. One weekend we were 
meant to be going fishing and he 
didn’t turn up. Well, not till 
late. And when he did, he was 
white as a sheet. I can see him 
now. “I’ve seen things today, 
Fletch”, he said. “That I never 
want to see again”. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  41.


Sherlock and John listen, fascinated. 
FLETCHER (CONT’D)
He’d been sent to some secret 
army place. Porton Down, maybe. 
Maybe Baskerville. Or somewhere 
else. And in the labs there, in 
some of the really secret labs he 
said he’d seen...terrible things.
Rats as big as dogs, he said.
He looks gravely at them.
FLETCHER (CONT’D)
And dogs. Dogs the size of 
horses...
And now he takes something from his ruck-sack. It’s a 
plaster cast of a dog’s footprint. A HUGE dog’s footprint.
Sherlock looks chastened. He turns to go. John clears his 
throat and holds out his hand. 
JOHN
We did say fifty?
Reluctantly, Sherlock gets out his wallet.
CUT TO:
EXT. GRIMPEN. HENRY’S HOUSE. NIGHT.

SHERLOCK make their way down an avenue of trees to Henry’s 
house.
SHERLOCK
‘Racing Post’ in his back pocket. 
Did you see it? You can always 
draw information from people like 
that with the threat of a bet. If 
I’d offered him a grand he’d 
never have told us as much! 
Henry’s house is unexpectedly imposing. A very old, 
ramshackle conservatory with a very modern extension (patio 
doors, security lights). 
They pass through a ruined, overgrown conservatory to get to 
the front door.
Sherlock rings the bell, then holds out his hand to John.
JOHN
No. I’m keeping that.
SHERLOCK
You can’t. It wasn’t a real bet. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  42.


JOHN
You owe me. 
SHERLOCK
Do I?
JOHN
Oh yes.
The door opens and Henry is framed there.
HENRY
Hi. Come in, come in. 
They pass through --

-- into the hallway. JOHN glances into a plush, well-
appointed Georgian room. Again, its opulence is surprising. 
JOHN
This is...

Are you...rich? 
HENRY
Yeah. 
JOHN
Right.
CUT TO:
INT. HENRY’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.

A bit later. SHERLOCK, JOHN and HENRY are finishing cups of 
coffee.
HENRY
A couple of words. That’s what I 
keep seeing. ‘Liberty’.
JOHN
Liberty? 
HENRY
‘Liberty’ and ‘in.’ Just that.
‘Liberty in.’ 
Sherlock glances at John. He shrugs.  
HENRY (CONT’D)
(of the cups)
You finished?
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  43.


JOHN
Ta.
Henry takes the cups to the sink.
JOHN (CONT’D)
(sotto, to Sherlock)
Mean anything to you? 
SHERLOCK
(grave)
“Liberty in death”? Isn’t that the 
expression? The only true freedom.
At the sink, Henry turns.
HENRY
What now then?
What now, then?
JOHN
Sherlock’s got a plan.
SHERLOCK
Yes.
HENRY
Right. 
He looks expectantly at Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
We take you back out onto the 
moor. 
HENRY
Ok.
SHERLOCK
And see if anything attacks you.
Beat. 
JOHN
What?
Henry looks appalled.
SHERLOCK
That should bring things to a 
head. 
HENRY
At night? You want me to go out 
there at night? 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  44.


JOHN
That’s your plan? Brilliant. 
SHERLOCK
Do you have any better ideas? 
JOHN
That’s not a plan! 
SHERLOCK
Look, if there’s a monster out 
there, John, there’s only one 
thing to do. Find out where it 
lives! 
CUT TO:

HENRY is leading SHERLOCK and JOHN over the rocky tor. The 
sun is setting over the wild, bleak landscape.

They enter the knot of twisted woodland where we first saw 
little Henry. 
CUT TO:
EXT. DARTMOOR. WOOD. NIGHT. 
37
37
Three torch beams slice through the darkness, lighting up 
the gnarled and sinister limbs of the ancient trees.
SHERLOCK points his torch down a narrow avenue of trees. 
The beam throws huge shadows over the ground. 
He walks on down the avenue. HENRY follows. 
JOHN lingers on his own for a moment, thoughtful. Then 
brings his torch to bear on the dark spaces between the 
trees.
They stand out like gaps in a mouthful of bad teeth. The 
darkness seems deep. Threatening.
He’s about to follow the others when something catches his 
eye, some way away on the moor.
It’s a light. Flashing intermittently on and off. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  45.


A signal?
John is immediately intrigued. 
He glances round for his companions but can’t see them so 
takes out his notebook and urgently scribbles down what 
appears to be a Morse message. 
JOHN
U...M...Q...R...A.
Umqra?
The light vanishes. 
John waits.
It comes back on, flashing very briefly.
John scribbles and waits. But the flashing has stopped.  
He hurries down the avenue of trees in search of Sherlock 
and Henry. 
CUT TO:
EXT. WOOD. KNOLL. NIGHT. 
38
38
SHERLOCK’s torch flickers over a grassy knoll.
SHERLOCK
We met a friend of yours.
HENRY
What? 
SHERLOCK
Dr Frankland. 
HENRY
Oh. Right. Bob. Yeah. 
SHERLOCK
He seems pretty concerned about 
you. 
HENRY
He’s a worrier. Bless him. He’s 
been very kind to me since I came 
back.
SHERLOCK
He knew your father?
HENRY
Yeah.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  46.


SHERLOCK
But he works at Baskerville.
Didn’t your dad have a problem 
with that? 
HENRY
Mates are mates, aren’t they? 
Look at you and John. 
SHERLOCK
What about us?
HENRY
Well, I mean. He’s a pretty 
straightforward bloke and -
He tails off. Sherlock is watching him closely. 
HENRY (CONT’D)
They agreed never to discuss 
work. Uncle Bob and my dad. 
SHERLOCK
It’s this way? The hollow?
HENRY
Yes.
They walk on. The ground begins to dip.
Below them is a strange hollow with darkened caves inset in 
it. As they walk down the slope, mist begins to creep over 
their shoes.
CUT TO:
EXT. WOOD. GLADE. NIGHT.
39
39
JOHN enters a glade, where the trees thin out a little.  
It’s silent as a tomb. He shines his torch. The strange, 
twisted trees throw grotesque shadows.
And then stops dead.  
Thud.
Thud.
Thud.
He listens. It comes again.
Thud. Thud. Thud. 
Regular as a heart beat. Where’s that coming from?
John glances over his shoulder. Sees nothing. He frowns. 
Not frightened. Just intrigued. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  47.


Thud. Thud. Thud.
In the warm emptiness, the sound is somehow strangely loud 
and unsettling. What is it?
Thud. Thud. Thud.
John shines his torch into the darkness. Sweeps it over the 
trees.
Thud. Thud. Thud.
The sound is closer. 
John quickens his step again. 
Thud. Thud. Thud.
Definitely closer. He starts to run towards the sound --
-- and almost falls over a big, rusted oil-drum that’s 
lying abandoned in the wood.  
He looks.
A gnarled tree overhangs the oil-drum and from the branches 
falls a steady stream of raindrops from a recent downpour. 
They’re hitting the rusty metal --
Thud. Thud. Thud.
John sighs. He turns back to face the way he’s come and --
SOMETHING flashes past him at speed. 
We see it. He doesn’t. 
John turns back. Then -- 
HOWWWWL!
-- a blood-curdling, unearthly howl splits the night air!!
John races off in the direction of the sound.   
JOHN
(calling)
Sherlock! 
He runs on, his torch beam bobbing and weaving through the 
trees.
HOWWWWL!
It comes again. Even more haunting and scary.
In the beam of his torch, the stark tree trunks stand out 
like skeletal fingers. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  48.


John hurries off in pursuit.  
CUT TO:
EXT. DARTMOOR. HOLLOW. NIGHT.

Fog ripples within the hollow. SHERLOCK appears on the lip 
of it and stumbles down the slope. HENRY is some way 
behind.
HOWWWWWL!
CLOSE on HUGE footprints in the wet soil of the slope.
A dog’s footprints. 
The beam of SHERLOCK’s torch illuminates them as he totters 
down the slope. He looks wildly round -- and stops dead. 
He stares and stares and stares. 
What is he seeing? 
We zoom into Sherlock, still as a statue. 
And then we cut to something’s POV of Sherlock.
Growwwl.
Sherlock freezes.
Then whatever it is races away. We can hear its great paws 
slapping at the marshy ground. 
Henry appears behind Sherlock and gawps -- 
HENRY
Ohmygodohmygodohmygod!! 
Did you ...did you see that? 
He swings round to Sherlock who is silent and pale. 
HENRY (CONT’D)
(to Sherlock)
Did you see it?
Sherlock says nothing. He just stands there with the fog 
billowing around him. 
CUT TO:
EXT. WOOD. NIGHT.

The beam of JOHN’s torch weaves over the uneven ground. 
Suddenly it picks out SHERLOCK. HENRY running behind him. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  49.


JOHN
Did you hear - ?
HENRY
(over)
We saw it. We saw it!
SHERLOCK
No.
Beat.
HENRY
What?
SHERLOCK
I didn’t see anything. 
HENRY
What’re you talking about?
SHERLOCK
(snarl)
I didn’t see anything! 
He stalks away. 
On Henry: what?? 
CUT TO:

In full running gear, CORPORAL LYONS jogs back towards the 
base. He nods to the MP on duty --
MP
‘Evening, sir.
--  and swipes his ID card.
Beep! 
As he passes through into the compound, something catches 
his eye. Distantly, out on the moor, a light flashes. He 
frowns. Then goes inside.
CUT TO:

CLOSE on a syringe as JOHN injects HENRY in the arm. Henry 
is in a total state, almost gibbering with fear. 
HENRY

He must’ve -- 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  50.


JOHN
Ok, get your head down now. Come 
on.
HENRY
Why would he say that? It was 
there. It was. 
John gently pushes Henry down onto the sofa and pulls a 
duvet over him. 
JOHN
Just try and relax. Ok? Get some 
sleep.
HENRY
I’m ok! Really I am. This is good 
news, John. It’s good. I’m not 
crazy. There is a Hound. There 
is. Sherlock saw it too. No 
matter what he says. 
On John: he doesn’t know what to think.

SHERLOCK is sitting alone by the fire. He looks pale and 
shaken. 
JOHN comes in and sits down opposite him. 
JOHN
He’s in a pretty bad way. Manic. 
He’s totally convinced there’s some 
kind of mutant super-dog on the 
moor. But there isn’t, is there? 
Cos if people could make mutant 
super-dogs, we’d know. They’d be 
for sale - that’s how it works.
Sherlock: no response.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Listen, I saw someone signalling. 
Out on the moor. Morse. I guess 
it’s Morse. Doesn’t make a lot of 
sense, though. U.M.Q.R.A. Mean 
anything to - ?
Still nothing. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
So. Ok. What have we got? There 
are footprints. Henry found them. 
So did that tour bloke. We all 
heard something...

(sighs)
Maybe we should just look for 
whoever’s got a big dog. 
SHERLOCK
Henry’s right.
JOHN
What?
Beat. 
SHERLOCK
I saw it too. 
JOHN
What? 
Sherlock turns to look at John. There’s a sort of mania in 
his red-rimmed eyes. 
SHERLOCK
I saw it too, John. 
JOHN
Hang on. You saw what exactly?
SHERLOCK
A hound. Out there. In the 
hollow. A giant hound.
Worried, John glances round.
JOHN
(sotto)
Look. Sherlock. We’ve got to be 
rational about this. Ok? You of 
all people can’t just - Let’s 
stick to what we know, yeah? To 
the facts. 
SHERLOCK
(grave)
Once you’ve ruled out the 
impossible, whatever remains, 
however improbable, must be true. 
JOHN
What the hell’s that supposed to 
mean?
Sherlock lifts his glass and gazes, fascinated, at his own 
trembling hand.
SHERLOCK
Look at me. I’m afraid, John.
Afraid.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  52.
JOHN (CONT’D)


JOHN
Sherlock - 
SHERLOCK
I’ve...I’ve always been able to 
keep myself detached. Divorce 
myself from...feelings. But look. 
My body is betraying me. 
Interesting. You see? Emotions - 
the grit on the lens, the fly in 
the ointment!
JOHN
Yeah, alright, Spock. Just take 
it easy. Look, you’ve been 
pretty...wired lately. You know 
you have. Maybe you got yourself 
worked up out there. A bit 
hysterical. 
SHERLOCK
Worked up?
JOHN
It was scary and dark and --
SHERLOCK
Me? There’s nothing wrong with 
me. 
Sherlock closes his eyes. His heartbeat pounds in his ears.
JOHN (O.S.)
Sherlock?
Sherlock doesn’t move. We hear his heart beat wildly on. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
Sherlock?
SHERLOCK
(suddenly furious)
There is nothing wrong with me! 
You understand? You want me to 
prove it? Do you?
He looks round wildly. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
We’re looking for a dog, yes? A 
great big dog! That’s your 
brilliant theory. Cherchez le 
chien! Excellent. Good. Yes! 
Where shall we start? 
He scans the room. There’s a MAN (40s, scruffy) in a loud 
jumper eating in silence with a smartly-dressed WOMAN 
(60s).
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  53.


SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
How about them - -
Text explodes around them: Christmas. Scars. Threadbare. 
Heels. Worn. Starter. Pudding. Wedding ring. Jewellery.
Cheap. Hairs. Knee high. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
-- the sentimental widow and her 
son the unemployed fisherman? The 
answer’s yes. 
JOHN
Yes?
SHERLOCK
She’s got a West Highland terrier 
called ‘Whisky’. Not really what 
we’re looking for.
JOHN
Sherlock, for God’s sake --
But he’s off like an express train, scarcely pausing for 
breath (sorry, Benedict).
SHERLOCK
Look at his jumper. Hardly been 
worn and he’s clearly 
uncomfortable in it. Maybe 
because of the material, more 
likely the hideous pattern. 
Suggests it was a gift. Probably 
Christmas. So, he wants into his 
Mother’s good books. Why? Almost 
certainly money. He’s treating 
her to a meal but his own portion 
is small. That means he wants to 
impress her but is still trying 
to economise on his own food. 
JOHN
Maybe he’s not very hungry.
SHERLOCK
No! Small plate - a starter - and 
he’s almost licked it clean. 
She’s onto her pavlova. If she’d
treated him, he’d have had as 
much as he could. He’s hungry 
alright. And not well off. You 
can see that from the state of 
his cuffs and his heels. 
(imitating John)
How do you know she’s his mother?
Who else would give him a 
Christmas present like that? 
Could be an Aunt. Older sister. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  54.
(MORE)


But mother’s most likely. Now he 
was a fisherman. The pattern 
scarring on his hands is from 
fish-hooks. Very distinctive. But 
they’re all quite old which means 
he’s been off work some time. Not 
much industry in this part of the 
world so now he’s turned to his 
widowed mother for help. 
(answering John’s 
unasked question)
Widow, yes! Obviously.
There’s a man’s wedding ring on a 
chain round her neck. Clearly her 
late husband’s but too big for 
her finger. She’s well-dressed 
but the rest of her jewellery is 
pretty cheap. She’s hung onto it 
even though she can afford 
better. Sentimental. Now. The 
dog. Little white hairs all over 
her legs from when it gets a bit 
too friendly. But the hairs don’t 
go further than the knee which 
says it’s a small dog, probably a 
terrier. Not really what we’re 
looking for. In fact it’s a West 
Highland terrier called Whisky. 
How the hell can you know that, 
Sherlock? Because they were on 
the same train as us and I heard 
her calling its name! And that’s 
not cheating, that’s listening. I 
use my senses, John, unlike some 
people. So. You see? I’m fine! In 
fact, I’ve never been better! SO 
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!
John sits back, as if struck. More punters look round. The 
whole pub is silenced. 
JOHN
Ok. No problem. Why would you 
want to listen to me? I’m just 
your friend. 
SHERLOCK
I don’t have friends.
Beat.
JOHN
No. I wonder why.
He gets up and stalks out of the pub. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  55.

Sherlock forms his hands into fists, desperate to hold 
himself together. He stares into the flickering flames of

JOHN strides furiously round the back of the pub into the 
beer garden. 
He plunges his hands into his pockets, fuming, then 
stiffens as he sees something. Out on the moor, in the 
darkness. 
The light again! 
It’s only there for a second. John peers ahead. Was it 
there?
Yes. The light comes again. Quickly on and off. On and off.
He looks back towards the village, hoping to see an 
answering signal. 
But there’s nothing. John glances towards the pub and then 
heads decisively towards the moor.

HENRY is sleeping. But he’s restless. Troubled. 
Quick, almost subliminal flash: ‘Liberty. ‘In’.
Henry reacts. 
Flash. 
‘Liberty, In’. The sentence again. But this time, a proper 
memory. It’s a logo, like a stitch-on patch on old jeans.
Henry opens his eyes, unsure where he is. Then he looks out 
through the patio windows at the great, dark, mysterious 
moor beyond.

John suddenly finds he’s off the moor and in a small 
moorland car park. 
There are several cars grouped around, all with their 
headlights off. 
John shines his torch over them. He catches quick glimpses 
of embarrassed-looking men.
In the middle of the area is another car, rocking gently 
from side to side. Its windows are steamed up. 
A terrible realisation dawns on John.
JOHN
Oh God.
As the car rocks, its headlights suddenly flash on and off, 
on and off. From inside the car:
ALISON (O.S.)
Mr Selden! You’ve done it again! 
SELDEN (O.S.)
Sorry. I keep catching it with my 
belt.
John clicks off his torch, turns swiftly on his heel and 
start striding away. 
As he strides away, his phone beeps. He yanks it out, bad-
temperedly. A text! It appears on screen.
HENRY’S THERAPIST CURRENTLY IN CROSS-KEYS PUB.
John, in no mood for this.
JOHN
So? 
Text: INTERVIEW HER? 
On John: no way.
Another beep. On screen:

Now close on John’s phone - a photograph of Louise Mortimer. 
She’s extremely attractive.
On John, looking resignedly at the photo.

HENRY is back on the sofa. The TV is blaring. He keeps 
glancing into the shadows as though being watched. On the 
TV screen, a big Alsatian appears. Henry hastily switches 
channels. 
His gaze flicks to the patio windows again. 
The garden is in total darkness. And then --
Snap. 
The outside security light bursts into life, flooding the 
garden with its bone-white glare. 
Henry starts. But doesn’t pay much attention. It’ll just be 
a bird or a squirrel. Usual thing. 
The garden looks strangely exposed in the light. We see a 
shed. A bike. A coiled garden hose. A spade leaning against 
the wall.
Then the security light clicks off again. 
Henry returns to watching the TV. He fumbles for the remote 
and changes channels. There’s another bloody dog on. Henry 
sighs, changes channels. Flick- flick-flick. And now 
there’s a werewolf movie on! Can’t get away from it! 
Angrily he turns off the TV --
Snap.
The security light comes on again. 
Henry gets up and shuffles to the patio doors. He looks 
out. 
Shed. Bike. Hose. Spade. All as before. 
Henry peers out, trying to make out some sign of life. 
Henry’s POV: Just as the light goes out again -- he sees 
something else. A big, bulky shape. Flitting swiftly past. 
Henry steps back from the window, scared. 
The light goes out again. 
And from outside comes a long, low GROWL...
Henry freezes. 
He doesn’t dare move. Sweat trickles down his forehead.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  58.


Again, from outside. GROWL... 
There’s a low, heavy breathing now and the sound of 
something very large padding around in the garden. 
Henry glances towards the table where a gun is lying. 
Heart pounding, he starts to sidle stealthily towards the 
weapon.
GROWL...
Henry reaches the gun and his sweating fingers close over it.
He turns, terrified, towards the pitch black patio windows.
His own breathing and his own heartbeat dominate now as 
moves closer...closer to the window.
Snap! The security light flashes back on and --
BANG!!
-- slamming its great paws against the glass door is --
THE HOUND!
We only see it for a second -- a huge black silhouette with 
demonic, blood red eyes.
Henry screams! 
The security light snaps off and the Hound vanishes from 
sight as though plucked back into the darkness.
The light snaps back on. The garden is empty.
Henry falls, sobbing to the floor. And his wails become -

JOHN
More wine, doctor?

The thought never occurred
LOUISE
Because a while ago I thought you

JOHN
Where did I go wrong?
LOUISE
When you started asking me about my 
patients ...
JOHN
Yeah, but I’m one of Henry’s oldest 
friends. 
LOUISE
And he’s one of my patients, so I 
can’t talk about him. 
(Shoots him a look)
Though he has told me about all his 
oldest friends - which one are you?
JOHN
... a new one. What about his 
father, he wasn’t your patient. 
Some sort of conspiracy nutter, 
yeah?
LOUISE
You’re only a nutter if you’re 
wrong.
JOHN
Was he wrong?
LOUISE
I should think so.
JOHN
Got fixated about Baskerville, 
yeah? What they were up to in 
there? Maybe Henry’s gone the same 
way - started imagining a Hound - 
LOUISE
Why do you think I’m going to talk 
about this?
JOHN
Because I think you’re worried 
about him. And because I’m a doctor 
too.
(Hesitates)
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  60.


And because I’ve got another friend 
who might be having the same 
problem.
On Louise - John is on the money, and this might just be the 
tipping point. She might actually open up.
And a hand claps down on John’s shoulder. It’s Frankland - 
not on his first drink.
FRANKLAND
Hello, Dr. Watson! How’s the 
investigation going?
JOHN
Um - hello ...
LOUISE
Sorry, what? Investigation?
FRANKLAND
Didn’t you know? Don’t you read the

Well - “live in” PA.

Oh, perfect!

JOHN
This is Dr. Mortimer, Henry’s

Tell Sherlock, I’ve been keeping an

With a cheery wave, he heads off to the bar.

SHERLOCK
‘Morning! How’re you feeling? 
HENRY (O.S.)
I’m -- I didn’t sleep very well --
SHERLOCK
That’s a shame. Shall I make us 
some coffee?
He darts into the kitchen --

HENRY comes in, pulling on a jumper. Sherlock is busy

HENRY
Listen. Last night. Why did you 
say you hadn’t seen anything? I 
mean, I only saw the Hound for a 
minute but - 
SHERLOCK
Hound. 
HENRY
What? 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  62.


SHERLOCK
Why do you call it a Hound? Why a 
Hound?
HENRY
Why? What do you mean, why?
SHERLOCK
It’s odd, isn’t it? It’s very 
odd. Strange choice of word. 
Archaic. That’s why I took this 
case - “Mr. Holmes, they were the 
footprints of a giant hound.” Why 
would you say hound?
Henry looks baffled.
HENRY
I dunno. I’ve never - 
SHERLOCK
Actually, I’d better skip the 
coffee. 
He dashes back out.

JOHN is sitting outside, looking through his notes. 
SHERLOCK suddenly appears from round the corner. 
A brief stand off. Neither speaks. 
At last --
SHERLOCK (O.S.)
Get anywhere with that Morse 
code? 
John shakes his head.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
U.m.q.r.a, wasn’t it? What could 
that mean? Umqra...
JOHN
Nothing. 
SHERLOCK
Umq --

Forget it. It’s -
I thought I was onto something. I 
wasn’t.

SHERLOCK
Sure?
JOHN
Yeah.
SHERLOCK
How about Louise Mortimer? Did you 
get anywhere with her?
JOHN
No.
SHERLOCK
Too bad. But did you get any 
information?
JOHN
Oh, you’re being funny now, are 
you?
SHERLOCK
I thought it might break the ice a 
bit.
JOHN
Funny doesn’t suit you. Stick to 
ice.
He gets up, makes to go.  
SHERLOCK
John -
JOHN
It’s fine.
SHERLOCK
No. Listen to me. 
John stops with his back to Sherlock.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Something happened last night. 
Something I’ve not really 
experienced before. 
JOHN
(bitter)
Yeah. You said. Fear. Sherlock 
Holmes got scared. You said. 
SHERLOCK
It was more than that, John. It 
was doubt. I felt....doubt. 
John glances at him, still not forgiving. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  64.


SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I thought I could trust my own 
senses. The evidence of my own 
eyes. Till last night.
JOHN
You can’t actually believe you 
saw some kind of monster - 
SHERLOCK
No. I can’t believe that. 
(smiles grimly)
But I did see it. So the question 
is - how? How? 
JOHN
Right. Ok. Good. You’ve got 
something to go on, then. Good 
luck with that. 
He crosses to the pub door.
SHERLOCK
Wait. What I said before, John. 
It’s true. I don’t have friends. 
Beat.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I’ve only got one. 
Beat.
John looks away. He’s touched but he’s not going to show 
it. 
JOHN
Right. 
He goes inside.
Sherlock suddenly cocks his head to one side, struck by a 
thought.
SHERLOCK
John, John, John....
He dashes after John into the pub.

Look, it’s ok. You don’t have to 
overdo the - 
SHERLOCK
You may not be very luminous 
yourself but as a conductor of 
light, you’re unbeatable!
JOHN
(not sure)
Cheers. What? 
SHERLOCK
Some people who aren’t geniuses 
have an amazing ability to 
stimulate it - 
JOHN
You were saying sorry a minute 
ago! I think. Don’t mess it up --
(sighs)
What? What did I do that’s so 
bloody stimulating? 
Sherlock takes out his notebook and hastily scribbles down 
the word ‘HOUND’. He holds it up.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Yeah. What of it?
Sherlock jabs his pen at the notebook.
SHERLOCK
Maybe it’s not a word. Maybe it’s 
individual letters.
He holds up the notebook again. It now reads ‘H.O.U.N.D’.
JOHN
An acronym? Why would it be an 
acronym? 
SHERLOCK
I have absolutely no idea. But 
there’s something....something I 
can’t quite remember -- 
He closes his eyes. Thinks, thinks, thinks. Opens his eyes.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
John -
John is staring ahead. Sherlock looks. A man in sunglasses 
is sitting at the bar, beaming at them. 
LESTRADE
Hello.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  66.


It’s LESTRADE! He’s tanned and dressed much more casually 
than usual. 
SHERLOCK
What’re you doing here?
LESTRADE
Nice to see you too.
I’m on holiday, would you 
believe? 
SHERLOCK
No. I wouldn’t. 
LESTRADE
Hello John.
JOHN
Greg.
LESTRADE
Heard you were in the area. 
What’re you up to? You after this 
Hound of Hell like on the telly?
SHERLOCK
I’m waiting for an explanation, 
Inspector. Why are you here?
LESTRADE
I told you, I’m -
SHERLOCK
You’re brown as a nut. Clearly 
you’ve just come back from your 
holidays. 
LESTRADE
(feebly)
Fancied another one. 
SHERLOCK
This is Mycroft, isn’t it?
LESTRADE
Look -
SHERLOCK
‘Course it is. One mention of 
Baskerville and he sends down my 
handler to spy on me. Incognito. Is 
that why you’re calling yourself 
‘Greg’?
JOHN
Greg’s his name!
SHERLOCK
Is it? 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  67.


LESTRADE
Yes! If you’d ever bothered to find 
out. Look. I’m not your handler, 
and I don’t just do what your 
brother tells me. 
JOHN
Actually, you might be just the 
man we want. 
SHERLOCK
Why?
JOHN
I haven’t been idle, Sherlock. I 
think I might have found 
something.
John roots in his pocket and takes out the receipt he took 
from the pub. 
Sherlock looks: ‘Undershaw Meat Supplies, Coombe Tracey’.
John nods towards the bar.
JOHN (CONT’D)
That’s a lot of meat for a 
vegetarian restaurant. 
SHERLOCK
(pleased)
Excellent. 
JOHN
A nice, scary inspector from 
Scotland Yard who can put in a 
few calls might come in very 
handy.
He goes to the bar and bangs the bell.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Shop! 
LESTRADE
Happy to help! 
Beat.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
(grins)
I will need your brother’s ID 
back, though.

GARY and BILLY are standing opposite SHERLOCK, JOHN and

looking through some photocopied papers. Sherlock is, 
rather surprisingly, making coffee again. 
Sherlock thrusts a mug at John.
JOHN
What’s this?
SHERLOCK
Coffee. I made coffee.
JOHN
You never make coffee. 
SHERLOCK
I just did. Don’t you want it? 
JOHN
Look, you don’t have to keep 
saying sorry...
Sherlock looks at him eagerly, like a puppy.
John takes a big swig. Pulls a face. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
I don’t take - 
Sherlock’s face falls. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
It’s good. Nice, yeah. 
He drinks more. Lestrade puts down the files, looks sternly 
at Gary and Billy.
LESTRADE
These records go back nearly two 
months. Was that when you had the 
idea? After the TV show went out? 
BILLY

(to Gary)
Sorry, Gary, I couldn’t help it. 
I had a bacon sandwich at Cal’s 
wedding and one thing led to 
another. 
LESTRADE
Nice try.
Gary and Billy look at each other. Gary sighs, defeated.
GARY
We were just trying to give 
things a bit of a boost, you 
know. Let a great big dog run 
wild on the moor. It was heaven 
sent. Like having our own Loch 
Ness Monster. 
LESTRADE
Where do you keep it? 
GARY
There’s an old mine shaft. Not 
far off. He was alright there. 
SHERLOCK
Was? 
GARY
We couldn’t control the bloody 
thing. It was vicious.
So Billy took it to the vet’s a 
about a month ago to...you 
know...
Beat.
JOHN
It’s dead?
GARY
Put down. 
BILLY
Yeah. No choice. So --

JOHN
Asperger’s?
SHERLOCK emerges form the pub.
LESTRADE
You believe them? About having 
the dog destroyed? 
SHERLOCK
No reason not to. 
LESTRADE
(brightly)
Well, hopefully no harm done. I’m 
not quite sure what I’d charge 
them with anyway. I’ll have a 
word with the local force. That’s 
that, then. Catch you later. I’m 
enjoying this! Nice to get London 
out of your lungs!
He goes off. 
JOHN
(to Sherlock)
So their dog is what people saw? 
Out there on the moor? 
SHERLOCK
Looks like it. 
JOHN
But that’s not what you saw. That 
wasn’t just an ordinary dog. 
SHERLOCK
No.

It was immense.

A neat, well-furnished office. There’s a bust of Churchill 
on the desk and a computer. Books line the facing wall. 
SHERLOCK is facing MAJOR BARRYMORE across it. He’s 
laughing.
BARRYMORE
Oh, do you know I’d love to. I’d 
love to give you unlimited access 
to this place. Why not? 
SHERLOCK
It’s a simple enough request, 
Major. 
BARRYMORE
I’ve never heard anything so 
bizarre.
SHERLOCK
You have to give me twenty four 
hours. That’s what 
I’ve...negotiated. 
BARRYMORE
And not a second more! I may have 
to comply with this order but I 
don’t have to like it. I don’t 
know what the hell you expect to 
find here, anyway. 
SHERLOCK
Perhaps the truth.
BARRYMORE
About what? 
He looks Sherlock up and down.
BARRYMORE (CONT’D)
Oh. I see! The big coat should’ve 
told me. You’re one of the 
conspiracy lot, aren’t you? 
(laughs)
Oh, well then go ahead. Seek them 
out. The monsters. The death 
rays. The aliens.
SHERLOCK
You have any of those? 
A look from Barrymore. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Just wondering.

Plastic strips flutter eerily in the draft. The door clicks 
slowly shut after them. 
John walks past the cages they saw earlier. They’re now all 
covered by dust sheets.
John spots the air-lock door through which Frankland first 
emerged. He glances at the cardboard warning sign - Keep Out! 
Unless you want a cold!!

slightly domesticated the room. A couple of white coats are 
hanging up along with gas-masks. There’s a nudie calendar and 
another of his ‘funny’ sighs. This one says ‘GET A GRIPPE!!!’
John glances at the pipes. They’re very old, rusty and 
leaking. Thin clouds of vapour are leaking from their cracked 
joints. There are gas cylinders attached to them.

John’s POV: the lights scorches into his retinas.
JOHN
Jesus -
Squinting, he looks around. Is there a switch? What the 
hell’s going on? He covers his eyes.
The light burns.
Then there’s a sound. A high-pitched hum. Like a physical 
assault. John can’t cover his eyes and his ears. 
The burning lights and the humming continue.
John runs towards the lift, scrabbling inside his jacket for 
his ID card. Hands shaking, he tries to swipe it through the 
security reader. 
It squawks. Negative.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  75.


He tries again. Same result. John can’t believe it. Not now! 
He tries once more. The reader won’t allow him to leave. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
Come on! 
No good. 
Suddenly the lights and the hum snap off. 
The room is plunged into darkness, lit only by tiny points of 
light - jellyfish glowing in glass cases, monitor lights etc.
It’s very quiet and very spooky. John looks round.
John’s POV: after-images float over his eyes. The burnt-in 
image of the overhead lights. Spots. Floaters. A pair of 
them. 
But now they look like a pair of eyes, dancing over his 
retinas. 
John blinks. Are they eyes? 
He peers into the gloom. The shapes seem to shift about, as 
though something is hiding from him.
John rubs his face. Tries to pull himself together. He takes 
out his torch and sweeps the beam around. 
He turns to the first of the sheeted cages and pulls away the 
cloth. Beneath is an empty metal cage. 
He moves onto the second. Another metal cage. Also empty. 
He pulls away the third, only half-looking --
SHRIEK! 
A grinning monkey glares up at him, teeth bared. John throws 
the sheet back the way it was, genuinely shocked.  He pulls 
himself together, really cross now and takes a few deep 
breaths. He’s a soldier. This is nothing. Yet he’s sweating. 
He clears his throat, then moves to the last of the sheeted 
shapes and pulls away the cloth. It’s a very tall 
rectangular, barred steel cage. And the end side is buckled. 
As though something BIG has forced its way out. 
John stares at the cage. It’s big enough to hold a gorilla. 
Or, perhaps, a dog the size of a horse...

Carefully he takes out his ID again and, as quietly as he 
can, swipes it through the reader. 
Squawk!
Negative. John looks anxiously round. Has it heard him? 
The footsteps seem to come from all around him. Echoing in 
the room. It’s like he’s being stalked.
He tries the reader again.
Squawk!
John looks desperately, anxiously about. Then he pulls out 
his phone and speed dials. It rings. And rings. 
JOHN

Come on, come on! 
John’s POV: slightly shaky. He seems to see the ‘eyes’ again, 
twinkling in the shadows.
The phone rings on. 
PHONE
The person you are calling is not 
available - 
John kills the call in frustration. He tries to stay calm.  
He points the torch down the room towards the exit through 
which he, Sherlock and Lyons left the room. It’s a long way 
off, but it’s the only one he hasn’t tried. 
Heart pounding, John starts to make his way down the lab, 
sweeping the torch beam back and forth. We see rabbits’ eyes 
glinting pinkly. We hear unseen rodents scratching and 
scrabbling about. 
Through the plastic sheeting, shadows seem to move as though 
alive. 
He’s almost reached the exit door, lifts his ID towards the 
reader and --
There’s a heavy, animalistic breathing. And a low, terrifying 
GROWWWWL.
It feels like it’s right by him. 
John RUNS wildly back the way he came, right towards the 
cages. He hurls open the door of one, jumps inside and slams 
the door. 
He hardly dares to breathe. We can hear his heart-beat 
thumping like a piston. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  78.


Very, very carefully, he reaches through the bars and starts 
to slowly drag the dust sheet back over the cage. 
Suddenly:
His phone rings! 
John almost yells and drops his phone as he tries to get it 
out from his jacket. He stabs at the buttons.

His eyes widen in absolute terror.

are huge and wide. 
John curls into a ball --
And the dust sheet is thrown back! The overhead lights 
flicker on. 
SHERLOCK
John! Are you ok? John? 
SHERLOCK throws open the cage door. John pushes past him, 
back into the main lab, now fully lit again.
There’s nothing there.

CLOSE on Sherlock as he switches slides, drops various 
liquids onto them, watches them dissolve and change colour. 
On a white-board close by he has written the word: HOUND.
By the H he has scribbled: HYDROGEN? 
By the N: NITROGEN? 
By the D: DEUTERIUM?
Then a host of chemical formulae.

(to John)
You’re sure you’re ok? You look 
very peeky.
JOHN
(terse)
I’m alright. 
STAPLETON
It was the GFP gene from a 
jellyfish, in case you were 
wondering.
JOHN
What?
STAPLETON
In the rabbits. Aequorea
victoria, if you really want to 
know. 
JOHN
Right. Yeah. Why? 
STAPLETON
Why not? We don’t ask questions 
like that here. It isn’t done. 
There was a mix up, anyway. My 
daughter ended up with one of the 
lab specimens. So...poor Bluebell 
had to go. 
JOHN
Your compassion’s overwhelming.
STAPLETON
I know. I hate myself sometimes.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  83.


JOHN
So. Come on. I’m not a nutter. 
You can tell me. What else have 
you got hidden away up here? 
Beat.
STAPLETON
(sighs)
Listen. If you can imagine it, 
someone’s probably doing it 
somewhere. Of course they are.
JOHN
Cloning?
STAPLETON
Yes. Of course! Dolly the Sheep, 
remember?
JOHN
Human cloning?
STAPLETON
Why not? 
JOHN
And what about animals? 
Beat.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Big animals. 
STAPLETON
Size isn’t a problem. Not at all. 
The only limits are ethics and 
the law. And both those things 
can be very....flexible. But not 
here. Not at Baskerville. I swear 
to you.
Suddenly Sherlock smashes the slide against the wall. 
SHERLOCK
It’s not there! There’s nothing 
there! It doesn’t make sense. 
STAPLETON
What were you expecting to find?
SHERLOCK
A drug, of course! It has to be a 
drug! An hallucinogenic or a 
deliriant of some kind. But 
there’s no trace of anything in 
the sugar!
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  84.


JOHN
Sugar?
SHERLOCK
Sugar! Yes! Simple process of 
elimination. I saw the Hound. Saw 
it as my imagination expected me 
to see it. A genetically 
engineered monster! I knew I 
couldn’t believe the evidence of 
my own eyes. There were seven 
possible reasons for it, the most 
likely being a narcotic. Henry 
Knight saw the Hound too. But you 
didn’t, John. You didn’t. We’d 
eaten and drunk the same things 
since we came to Grimpen, except 
for one thing. You don’t take 
sugar in your coffee. 
He points angrily at the smashed slide. 
JOHN
I see. So --
SHERLOCK
I took that from Henry’s kitchen. 
His sugar. But it’s perfectly 
alright. 
JOHN
Maybe it isn’t a drug?
SHERLOCK
It must be! But how did it get 
into our systems? How? 
He throws himself down into a chair. Puts his head in his 
hands.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(sighs)
There’s something...something
buried deep.
He sits back in the chair. Closes his eyes and steeples his 
fingertips.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Get out.
STAPLETON
What?
SHERLOCK
I need to go to my mind palace. 
Get out.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  85.


STAPLETON
Your what?
But he doesn’t answer. John sighs.
JOHN
He’s not going to be doing much 
talking for a while. We might as 
well go. 
STAPLETON
His what? 
JOHN
Mind palace. It’s a memory 
technique. A sort of mental map. 
You map out a location. Doesn’t 
have to be a real place. Then 
you...deposit memories there. 
Theoretically, you can never 
forget anything. All you have to 
do is find your way back to it. 
He moves towards the door. 
STAPLETON
So this...imaginary location. It 
can be anything. Like a street or 
a house?
JOHN
Yeah.
STAPLETON
But he said palace. He said his 
was a palace. 
JOHN
Yeah, well he would, wouldn’t he?
They go out. 
We stay on Sherlock. He’s still as a statue.
We zoom into his closed eyes - almost unbearably close. 
Across the left-hand side of his face a photograph appears. 
It’s a familiar floral pattern. A Liberty pattern. 
The photo clicks upwards like the dial of a fruit machine. 
Replaced by a picture of the Liberty store in London, then  
by the symbol of the French Republic - liberte, egalite, 
fraternite - then by one of the Liberty Bell. The cracked 
symbol of American Independence. Then John Philip Sousa, 
composer of the Liberty bell March. Then they spin into a 
blur --

Finally a third picture appears on the right side of

All three columns are now spinning wildly like a fruit

HENRY is running for his life. 
He pounds across the moor, his feet slipping and sliding on

He looks over his shoulder, utterly terrified. 
Silhouetted against the moon he sees: the Hound! 
Its eyes are livid red.
Howwwwl!
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  87.


He races on, but the great beast comes after him.
Suddenly Henry realises he has a gun in his hand. He looks at 
it for a long moment, nonplussed, then turns to face the 
monster.
Breath coming in huge, ragged bursts he aims the gun.
The Hound pounds on, snarling with rage. 
And Henry fires!
Close on Henry’s eyes. He blinks. Sways on his feet --

him.
LOUISE MORTIMER is cowering in the corner, terrified. There’s

A door opens and overhead lights flicker on, revealing a 
big, impressive control room packed with CC-TV monitors and

SHERLOCK, JOHN and STAPLETON enter.
SHERLOCK
John?
JOHN
I’m on it.
John guards the door. 
SHERLOCK (O.S.)
‘Project H.O.U.N.D.’
I must have read about it

Stapleton sits down, facing the main computer. She swipes 
her ID card through a reader on the side  --

away at the keyboard. 
She goes through the various protocols.

HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  89.


STAPLETON
That’s as far as my access goes, 
I’m afraid. 
JOHN
There must be an override. A 
password.
STAPLETON
I imagine so. But that’d be Major 
Barrymore’s.  
On Sherlock: not a problem. He crosses to Barrymore’s office 
chair and flops down in it.
SHERLOCK
Password, password, password.
He’d have sat here, thinking it 
up.
His gaze roams forensically around the low-lit room. The 
bust of Churchill. A black and white photo of a man in 
uniform with a skinny teenage boy. Children’s paintings. 
Neatly ordered books. Well-watered plants.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Describe him to me. 
STAPLETON
You’ve seen him.
SHERLOCK
Describe him. 
STAPLETON
He’s a bloody martinet. A throw 
back. The sort they’d have sent 
into Suez.
SHERLOCK
Good. Excellent. Old-fashioned. A 
traditionalist. Not the sort of 
man who’d use his children’s 
names as a password. Loves his 
job. Proud of it. And this is 
work-related. 
He gazes a round the room.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Sitting here. What’s at eye-
level? Books. 
(he peers)
Jane’s defence weekly. Bound 
copies. Hannibal, Wellington. 
Rommel. Churchill’s ‘History of 
the English-Speaking Peoples’. 
All four volumes. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  90.


Glances at the bust. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Churchill. He likes Churchill.
But...there’s also ‘The Downing 
Street Years’. In fact... one, 
two, three, four, five separate 
biographies of Mrs Thatcher.
He glances at the photo on the desk. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Mid 1980s, I’d say. Father and son. 
Barrymore Snr? Medals. 
(nods to photo)
Distinguished Service Medal. His 
father was a soldier too. 
JOHN
That date. Could only have been a 
Falklands veteran. 
SHERLOCK
Right. Thatcher’s looking a 
better bet than Churchill. 
STAPLETON
So that’s the password?

No. For a man like Major

name terms would do.

H.O.U.N.D.!
Sherlock reads it all with almost supernatural speed. 
Black and white photos of shaven-headed soldiers - front 
and side on, like criminals. 
On-screen, a blur of text. ‘Extreme suggestibility’. ‘Fear 
and stimulus’. ‘Conditioned terror’. ‘Aerosal dispersal’.
Later photos of the same men, their faces contorted into 
terrifying, manic scowls. Eyes bulging. Mouths slavering. 
More text. ‘Paranoia’. ‘Severe frontal lobe damage’. ‘Blood-
brain’. ‘Neuro-chemical functions’. ‘Dangerous 
acceleration’. ‘Gross cranial trauma’. ‘Multiple homicide’. 
Almost subliminal colour photos. Victims. Blood. Broken 
bones. Cells bathed in spattered blood. 
JOHN
Jesus. 
On-screen: Project H.O.U.N.D. CANCELLED. 17/4/86
SHERLOCK
Project H.O.U.N.D. A new 
deliriant drug which rendered the 
subjects incredibly suggestible. 
They wanted to use it as an anti-
personnel weapon. To totally 
disorientate the enemy through 
fear and stimulus. But it was 
shut down and hidden away in 
1986.
Stapleton reads from the screen. 
STAPLETON
Because of what it did to the 
subjects it was tested on? 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  92.


SHERLOCK
(darkly)
And what they did to others. 
Prolonged exposure drove them 
insane. Made them almost 
uncontrollably aggressive. 
JOHN
So, someone’s been doing it 
again? Carrying on the 
experiments? 
SHERLOCK
Attempting to refine it, perhaps. 
For the last twenty years. 
STAPLETON
Who?
JOHN
Did those names mean anything to 
you?
STAPLETON
No. Not a thing. 
SHERLOCK
The five principal scientists. 
Twenty five years ago. Maybe our 
friend is somewhere in the 
background...Someone who’s the 
right age to have been on that 
project back in 1986. 
(new thought)
Perhaps someone who says ‘cell 
phone’ because of the time they 
spent in America. You remember, 
John? He gave us his number, in 
case we needed him.
Sherlock finds the photo of the scientists and clicks on 
the enlarge option. 
The picture gets bigger. Bigger. Bigger. 
The faces are unfamiliar -- until one. 
STAPLETON
Oh my God!
We see a young FRANKLAND grinning in the photo. 
STAPLETON (CONT’D)
But Bob doesn’t work on -- I 
mean, he’s a virologist. This was 
chemical warfare, wasn’t it?
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  93.


SHERLOCK
This is where he started, though. 
And he’s never lost that 
certainty, that obsession that 
the drug could really work.  
Something else in the photo is suddenly very clear. The 
identical sweat-shirts that the team all wear. An iron-on 
transfer design of a howling dog and underneath it the 
logo: H.O.U.N.D. Liberty, In.
Sherlock takes out his phone.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Kind of him to give us his 
number. Let’s arrange a little 
meeting.
Suddenly John’s phone rings. He glances at it and is about 
to turn it off but the number intrigues him.
JOHN

Hello? 
On the other end of the phone we can just hear sobbing.

A man in a gas-mask is locked in a savage fight with 
CHARLIE, hands wrapped round Charlie’s throat, throttling

The horrible gas mask has red lenses. They flash vividly

Under a rocky outcrop, watching in mute terror is HENRY. 
Charlie grapples with the gas-mask and pulls it aside. 
Just for a moment we see: FRANKLAND!
Then he slams Charlie against a rock. There’s a horrible - 
crack! - and Charlie’s head lolls to one side. His neck has 
been broken. 
As little Henry watches, wide-eyed, the fog swirling around 
him, Frankland sinks back against the rocks and pulls the 
gas-mask back over his face. In the beam of Charlie’s 
abandoned flash-light, Frankland’s torso is illuminated. 
He’s wearing a faded sweatshirt with the now-familiar 
‘howling dog’ logo and the legend H.O.U.N.D. Liberty, In.

I’d come out if I were you, Dr

Nothing moves.
Then there’s a figure in the fog. Walking slowly forward. 
The fog is so thick it’s impossible to see who it is. But 
he raises a rifle and points it at Sherlock. 
John aims his gun at the figure. But another gun clicks.
They turn. LESTRADE is walking down the slope, his own 
pistol trained on Frankland. 
LESTRADE
Don’t do anything silly, sir. 
Henry stares at the apparition.
HENRY
But we saw it! The Hound. Last 
night. We did! 
SHERLOCK
There was a dog out here, Henry. 
Leaving footprints. Scaring 
witnesses. But it was nothing 
more than an ordinary dog. We 
both saw it. But we saw it the 
way our drugged minds wanted us

That’s how it works. But there 
never was any monster.

Alright! It’s still there! But 
it’s just a dog. Nothing more

At last the fog parts above the lip of the hollow revealing 
--

It’s IMMENSE! As big as a horse! A hound from Hell with 
massive, distended, drooling jaws and blazing red eyes. And 
it’s glowing!
LESTRADE
Oh my God!

human figure in the fog. As he gets closer we see the 
figure is wearing a gas mask.

The fog!!
JOHN
What?
SHERLOCK
It’s the FOG!! The drug’s in the 
fog! 
He grabs Jim by the lapels and shakes him, willing things 
to become clear.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(savage, angry)
Aerosol dispersant, that’s what 
it said in those records. Project 
H.O.U.N.D. It’s the FOG! 
‘Jim’ resists, tries to get out of Sherlock’s grip, 
struggling to get the gas mask back on. Sherlock slaps 
himself across the face, forcing himself to see clearly. 
Sherlock’s POV: Jim’s face blurs. Changes. 
And FRANKLAND is there, in Sherlock’s grip. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
A minefield! A chemical minefield.
Howwwwl! 
The Hound begins to race towards them down the slope, its 
massive paws throwing up the soil in great wet spumes. 
FRANKLAND
For God’s sake! Kill it! KILL 
IT!! 
He tries to raise the rifle. 
Lestrade struggles to see through the fog. His finger 
squeezes the trigger and he looses off three bullets. 
Misses.
The Hound ploughs on towards them, jaws dripping until --
BANG! BANG! BANG! 
On John: the marksman. In total control. He takes it down. 
The Hound shrieks in pain, rolling over and over. 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  103.


SHERLOCK
Look at it! Really look!
John stares at it. Blinks. 
John’s POV: the Hound is suddenly diminished. A big, savage-
looking Great Dane. But only a dog. It lies still. 
Suddenly HENRY launches himself at Frankland, punching  him 
violently to the ground. 
HENRY
Bastard! You bastard! You 
BASTARD!! Twenty years!  Twenty 
years of my life, making no 
sense!! Why didn’t you just kill 
me??
Lestrade drags him off Frankland.
LESTRADE
Ok, son. It’s ok!
SHERLOCK
Because dead men get listened to. 
It wasn’t enough to kill you - he 
had to discredit every word you 
ever said.
HENRY
About my father’s death.
SHERLOCK
Exactly. And Frankland had the 
means, right at his feet. A 
chemical minefield! Pressure pads 
in the ground! Dosing you up every 
time you came back here. Murder 
weapon and scene of the crime all 
at once. Oh, this case, Henry! 
Thank you! It’s been brilliant!
JOHN
Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
What?
JOHN
(sotto)
Timing, for God’s sake. Not now! 
SHERLOCK
Not good?
JOHN
His whole life’s been messed up. 
Give him a minute - 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  104.


HENRY
No! No, no, it’s ok. It’s fine! 
Because it means my Dad was right. 
Everything he said about 
Baskerville was true! 
(to Frankland)
He’d found something out, hadn’t 
he? That’s why you killed him. 
Because he wasn’t mad, he was 
right! And he found you right in 
the middle of an experiment. 
Henry triumphant, the ghosts of the past, buried. But 
Frankland is smiling cynically.
FRANKLAND
I let him find me. Only way I could 
get him alone. 
Henry’s face falls. 
HENRY
But why....why would you...?
FRANKLAND
I had a wife once. 
Beat.
FRANKLAND (CONT’D)
Your father had her too.
A horrible silence as this hits home in Henry. Then...
Growwwwl.
Everyone swings round. It’s a last sign of life from the 
Hound. John fires! Now it’s definitely dead. 
But Frankland takes advantage of the distraction -- and 
tears off into the darkness.
The four men race after him. 
CUT TO:
EXT. DARTMOOR. FENCE. NIGHT.

FRANKLAND staggers on and reaches a trampled-down wire 
fence. He pauses to grab a ragged breath, then clambers 
over. 
He doesn’t notice the skull and cross-bones warning sign. 
He scrambles in his pockets to find a torch. With shaking 
hands he clicks it on and points the beam dead ahead.
The ground seems clear so he stumbles on.
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  105.


Suddenly, there’s a dull metallic click.
Hand shaking, Frankland brings the torch beam to bear on 
the ground at his feet.  He’s standing on a rusty pressure-
mine. The slightest wrong move...
Frankland swallows, petrified.
CUT TO:
EXT. DARTMOOR. FENCE. NIGHT.

100
BOOOOOOM!!
A massive fireball erupts across the moor. SHERLOCK, JOHN, 
LESTRADE and HENRY hurl themselves to the ground. The vast, 
bleak moor is briefly lit up by the explosion, as if by a 
bolt of summer lightning. 
On Henry:  grimly satisfied. 
CUT TO:
EXT. ‘THE CROSS KEYS’. DAY.

JOHN is demolishing his breakfast. SHERLOCK comes out of 
the pub, carrying two mugs of coffee.
SHERLOCK
(puzzled)
So...They didn’t have it put 
down. The dog. 
JOHN
Obviously. Suppose they just 
couldn’t bring themselves to do 
it 
SHERLOCK
I see. 
JOHN
No, you don’t. 
SHERLOCK
No, I don’t. Sentiment? 
JOHN
Sentiment. 
John eats.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Listen - What happened to me. In 
the lab. What was all that about? 
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  106.


SHERLOCK
(evasive)
Do you want any sauce?
JOHN
I’d never been to the hollow. So 
how come I heard those things? In 
there? Fear and stimulus, you 
said.
SHERLOCK
You must have been dosed 
elsewhere. When you went to look 
in the labs, maybe. You saw those 
pipes. Pretty ancient. Leaky as a 
sieve. And that’s where the gas 
was coming from. Ketchup, was it? 
Or Brown? 
JOHN
Hang on. 
He fixes Sherlock with a beady glare.
JOHN (CONT’D)
You thought it was in the sugar, 
right? You were convinced it was 
in the sugar.   
SHERLOCK
We’d better get going, actually. 
There’s a train at -
It dawns on John. 
JOHN
It was you! You locked me in that 
bloody lab!
SHERLOCK
I had to. It was an experiment.
JOHN
(bellows)
AN EXPERIMENT! 
SHERLOCK
Shh!
JOHN
I was terrified, Sherlock. I was 
scared to death!
SHERLOCK
I thought the drug was in the 
sugar. So I put the sugar in your 
coffee. Then I arranged 
everything with Major Barrymore.

It was all totally scientific. 
Laboratory conditions. Literally.

A bank of CC-TV monitors show JOHN trapped inside the cold 
storage room. 
SHERLOCK is watching with his feet up. He’s on his phone. 
SHERLOCK 
Alright. I’ll find you. Keep 
talking.
JOHN (V.O.)
No! It’ll hear me. 
SHERLOCK 
Keep talking. What are you 
seeing? 
He clicks on a digital recorder placed next to a tannoy. 
The tape plays --

SHERLOCK
I knew what effect it had on a 
superior mind. I needed to try it 
on an average one. 
On John: I am going to kill you.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
You know what I mean. 
Beat. 
JOHN
But it wasn’t in the sugar. 
SHERLOCK
No. I wasn’t to know you’d 
already been exposed to the gas. 
JOHN
So you got it wrong. 
SHERLOCK
No -
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  108.
SHERLOCK (CONT'D)


JOHN
You were wrong. You thought it 
was in the sugar. You got it 
wrong. 
SHERLOCK
A little bit. 
Beat. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Won’t happen again. 
John calms down somewhat. 
JOHN
Any... long...term effects?
SHERLOCK
Not at all. You’ll be ok once 
you’ve excreted it. We all will.
Beat. 
JOHN
Yeah, well. Think I might have 
taken care of that already. 
Sherlock looks at him. They laugh.
GARY comes out of the pub. He catches Sherlock’s eye and 
smiles feebly. 
Sherlock gets up.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Where are you going?
SHERLOCK
Won’t be a minute. Gotta see a 
man about a dog. 
CUT TO:
EXT/INT. CELL. DAY.

104
Darkness. A door half opens, framing a familiar, silhouetted 
elfin FIGURE (we don't see his face)
Next to him is a MAN IN A SUIT who nods towards the door. 
Tells the figure it's time to go.
The silhouetted figure pauses for a long moment, then exits.
Inside the cell, the suited man sighs heavily and looks 
around the walls.
His POV: scratched onto the wall, one word: SHERLOCK
HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  109.


We pull back to see that the entire cell is COVERED in the 
same angry, jagged lettering. Everywhere, scrawled, scraped, 
gouged into the plaster:
SHERLOCK. SHERLOCK. SHERLOCK. SHERLOCK. SHERLOCK...
END
