On ELLA - JOHN’S THERAPIST.
Her consulting room. Pale sunlight.
ELLA
Why now?
Camera turns around - JOHN on the sofa. Again. First time 
in an age. He stares at the window. Can’t seem to look at 
her.
ELLA (CONT’D)
John? 
(Still nothing from him)
Why today? 
(Checks her notes)
Eighteen months since your last 
appointment.
JOHN
You want to hear me say it?
(Beat)
You read the papers. 
ELLA
Sometimes.
JOHN
You watch TV. You know why I’m 
here. It’s because... 
Can’t say it.
ELLA
What happened, John?
And he burst into tears. A soldier’s tears. Not an 
hysterical flood - but the tears of someone who hates 
crying. 
ELLA (CONT’D)
You need to get it out.
JOHN
Sherlock.
ELLA
Yes.
JOHN
My best friend. Sherlock Holmes. 
He’s gone.
Music swells and...
OPENING TITLES


INT. GALLERY. DAY
1
1
TIGHT IN on a painting. A rich, Romantic landscape - A 
cascading waterfall.
Camera pulls back - 
The painting on a easel, in front of a (small) crowd. The 
DIRECTOR of the Gallery addressing them. 
DIRECTOR
... ‘Falls of the Reichenbach’. 
Turner’s masterpiece. Thankfully 
recovered, owing to the 
prodigious talent of Mr. Sherlock 
Holmes...
He beams at JOHN and SHERLOCK. A ripple of applause for our 
heroes. Shake hands.
SHERLOCK looking bored. JOHN smiling his arse off to try to 
compensate.
Offers SHERLOCK a small gift - a little box wrapped in posh 
paper.
DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
A small token of our gratitude -
SHERLOCK
(Graceless)
Diamond cufflinks.
Odd. Hasn’t even unwrapped it yet but knows what it is all 
the same. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
My cuffs all have buttons. 
JOHN
He means ‘Thank you’.
SHERLOCK
Do I?
JOHN
(Mutters firmly)
Say it.
SHERLOCK
Thank you.
Cameras clicking --
JOHN notices the small gaggle of REPORTERS, come to cover 
the story. Scribbling in their pads...
Out on JOHN, frowning - what are they writing? 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

EXT. GALLERY/CAB. DAY
2
2
Coming out of the Gallery, into the street - 
SHERLOCK
High-functioning sociopath 
remember, John? I don’t do 
“please” and “thankyou” and all 
those ... slow bits.
JOHN
Sociopath, I get. Still waiting for 
the ‘high functioning’.
Chin-nods at the REPORTERS, leaving to file their stories.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Look at them all. Off to file their 
stories.
SHERLOCK
I know.
JOHN
About you.
SHERLOCK
So?
On John, troubled, watching them.
JOHN
Watch it. That’s all, just watch 
it.
EXT. LONDON STREET. DAY
3
The front steps of a Kensington home. A smiling FAMILY - 
FATHER, MOTHER, SON - facing the press, SHERLOCK and JOHN 
beside them.
FATHER
... back with my family, after my 
terrifying ordeal. And we have 
one person to thank for my 
deliverance. Sherlock Holmes...
More applause. The little boy offers SHERLOCK a ‘Thank you’ 
gift - again, in wrapping paper.
SHERLOCK
(Aside to John, sighs)
Tie pin. Don’t wear ties.
JOHN
Sh.
How does he do it with the wrapping still on?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

The press gaggle a little bigger. Clicking cameras take us 
into -
INT. OFFICE. DAY

SCENE IS CUT
INT. SCOTLAND YARD. DAY
5
5
The press room at Scotland Yard. LESTRADE at the podium. 
SHERLOCK and JOHN beside him.
He clicks on a projector lead and an ugly-looking mug shot is  
projected on a screen.
LESTRADE
Peter Ricoletti. Number one on 
Interpol’s most wanted list since 
1982. Well...
(beams)
...we’ve got him. And there’s one 
person we have to thank for 
giving us the decisive leads...
He looks over to Sherlock. And there’s Sherlock and John, a 
little uneasy in front of the biggest press gaggle we’ve 
seen.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
... with all his customary 
diplomacy and tact.
JOHN
(Sotto; to Sherlock)
Sarcasm.
SHERLOCK
Yes!
On the press applauding.
Now on a parcel being passed over to John, then to Sherlock. 
On Sherlock, looking grim, getting it already.
LESTRADE
We all chipped in. 
Over at the side: ANDERSON and SALLY DONOVAN, smirking at 
what’s to come -
- and Sherlock has unwrapped ... a deerstalker.
Cries from the press. “Put it on!” “Put the hat on.”
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
Yeah, Sherlock. Put it on.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
4.


JOHN
(Sotto)
Get it over with.
Glowering, Sherlock pops the hat on his head. A fusillade of 
camera flashes. Flash! Flash! Flash! Each one becomes a 
different newspaper photograph of Sherlock glowering in his 
hated deerstalker. 
On the final flash we cut to:
INT. 221B BAKER ST. DAY
6
6
- the DEERSTALKER, now skewered to the MANTELPIECE with
Sherlock’s KNIFE (in place of the usual mail.)
SHERLOCK (O.S.)
Boffin??
Sherlock has just thrown aside a NEWSPAPER, is now pacing the 
flat, angrily.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
‘Boffin’ Sherlock Holmes.
On JOHN. He’s sitting with a pile of newspapers. The boys are 
checking their reviews.
JOHN
(Shrugs)
Everybody gets one.
SHERLOCK
One what?
JOHN
Tabloid nickname. ‘Foxy Knoxy’. 
‘Nasty Nick’. Shouldn’t worry. 
I’ll probably get one soon.
SHERLOCK
Page five. Column six. First 
sentence.
JOHN is now scanning the paper -
JOHN
“Bachelor”?
SHERLOCK
And it’s always the hat photograph! 
Every time, the hat!
JOHN
‘Bachelor John Watson’??
Sherlock has ripped the deerstalker from the mantel, now 
examines it in disgust.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
5.


JOHN (CONT’D)
‘Bachelor’!? What the hell are 
they - (implying?)
SHERLOCK
What kind of hat is it anyway? Is 
it a cap? Why’s it got two fronts?
JOHN
It’s a deerstalker.
(Raeads)
‘Frequently in the company of 
bachelor John Watson’. 
SHERLOCK
How do you stalk a deer with a 
hat? What do you do, throw it?
JOHN
(Another paper)
-“Confirmed bachelor John Watson.” 
-
SHERLOCK
- Like a death-frisbee! -
JOHN
Okay, this is too much. We need to 
be more careful.
SHERLOCK
It’s got ear-flaps. John, it’s an 
ear-hat!!
(Registers what John is 
glowering at)
Careful?  What do you mean?
John snatches the deerstalker from him.
JOHN
I mean this isn’t a deerstalker now 
- it’s a Sherlock Holmes hat. I
mean you’re not exactly a private
detective any more. You’re this far
from famous.
SHERLOCK
It’ll pass.
JOHN
It better pass. Because the press 
will turn, Sherlock. They always 
turn, and they’ll turn on you.
SHERLOCK
It actually bothers you.
JOHN
What?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
6.


SHERLOCK
What people say.
JOHN
Yes!
SHERLOCK
About me. I don’t understand. Why 
would it upset you?
JOHN is going to say it - but then changes his mind.
JOHN
Just try to keep a low profile. 
Find yourself a little case this 
week. Stay out of the news.
EXT. TOWER OF LONDON. DAY
7
7
Camera soars over London -  TIGHT IN on Tower Hill. 
Caption: ‘Tower Of London 11am’.
Ravens. Beefeaters. Traitor’s gate. The Bloody Tower. 
Snaking queues of tourists lining up outside the kiosk. 
TIGHTER STILL on a swarm of TOURISTS inside the walls -
BEEFEATER
(Announcement)
Crown Jewels.
Camera whips around. 
Standing in the middle of the group, taking photos with his 
Smartphone - 
JIM MORIARTY. 
Wearing a baseball cap that says ‘I love London’. And 
chewing gum.
INT. JEWEL ROOM. DAY
8
8
TOURISTS walk through a metal detector as they enter the 
Jewel Room itself. Emptying their pockets -
JIM puts his Smartphone in the plastic tray - passes through 
the metal detector without incident.
Walks inside and sees... The Crown Jewels.
The Imperial State Crown, teeming with diamonds, trimmed 
with ermine. Sceptre. Jewelled orb. All surrounded by a 
humming network of red laser beams. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
7.


Metal screens hover over the entrances, ready to slam shut 
if any one of the beams is cut. 
And up above - the ceiling is filled with rotating cameras, 
chattering and whirring -
JIM takes out a pair of headphones, coolly places them in 
his ears and clicks ‘Play’ on his Smartphone.
Music starts to play - ROSSINI, ‘LA GAZZA LADRA’. Plays 
through the entire Tower of London sequence -
CUT TO:
Bank of TV screens.  
A SECURITY GUARD studies them. A SECOND GUARD stands just 
behind him, idly watching. It’s a boring day. 
The screens: we see the guided tour passing through the 
jewel house. They dwindle then disappear. One person 
lingers behind as they go...
JIM, listening to his music. The SECOND SECURITY GUARD says 
something like, “fancy a cuppa?” 
INT. BANK OF ENGLAND. DAY
9
9
CUT TO a fine bone china cup and saucer. A young man in a 
suit (INTERN) carries it through an oak-panneled office.
Caption: ‘Bank of England 11am’.
The BANK DIRECTOR (MERVYN KING lookalike, basically - mop 
of grey hair and glasses) sits at his desk scanning his 
computer screen. Studying the exchange rates.
BANK DIRECTOR
Gilts at seven. Dutch Telecoms in 
free-fall.
The INTERN gingerly puts his tea in front of him. 
BANK DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
Thank you, Harvey.
Just before it lands we CUT AWAY to...
INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON. DAY
10
10
The PRISON GOVERNOR’S office. 
Caption: ‘Pentonville Prison 11am’.
A PRISON WARDER plonks a tea tray on the table - prison 
issue mugs and a biscuit barrel. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
8.


THE GOVERNOR’S in a meeting - a parole hearing. A handful 
of staff around a table, wading through a huge stack 
prisoners’ personal files. He sighs.
GOVERNOR
What d’you say? Refuse them all 
parole and bring back the rope?
No-one laughs.
GOVERNOR (CONT’D)
Oh well. 
Wearily, he picks up the first heavy file.
INT. TOWER OF LONDON. DAY
11
11
JIM in the jewel room - music still playing.
He has a little plastic aerosol. Taps the GUARD on the 
shoulder and sprays him in the mouth as he turns. The GUARD 
collapses to the floor from effect.
Next he reaches into his jacket - produces a small plastic 
capsule which he snaps and throws into the corner. 
It explodes! A smoke bomb. Then a second one -
Smoke everywhere. The few remaining TOURISTS run for the 
exit.
TIGHT IN on the Smartphone display. 
He finds an App called ‘JEWEL HOUSE’ - the Queen’s crown 
emblazoned on it. Presses it -
And our screen suddenly fills with text - computer code. 
(The on-screen texts in this episode are lines and lines 
and lines of binary computer code.)
10010110011010001010111010101001001011001100011100000101...
TIGHT IN on a circuit board - a digital signal whizzing 
down the wires. The electrical pulse reaches it’s 
destination - sparks -
A metal gate suddenly comes crashing down.
JIM presses it again. Another gate. And then another. 
INT. TOWER OF LONDON, SECURITY. DAY
12
12
The GUARD saunters back into the SECURITY ROOM with his 
styrofoam cup of tea.
Beeep. Beeep. Beeep.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
9.


His display panel is lighting up like a Christmas tree. The 
gates are slamming shut. The laser beams all cutting out.
Spills his tea (crushes the cup?) and dashes to the 
phone...
INT. SCOTLAND YARD. DAY
13
13
SERGEANT DONOVAN scuttles into the office - looking for 
LESTRADE. LESTRADE eating a bun and drinking coffee.
DONOVAN
Sir, there’s been a break-in.
LESTRADE
(Barely audible)
Not our division. 
DONOVAN
You’ll want it.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY
14
14
JOHN in his dressing gown, wet hair.
SHERLOCK’S MOBILE beeping madly on the desk - he glances 
over to see SHERLOCK working away at his microscope. 
Just beyond Sherlock there is - apparently - a MAN HANGING 
BY HIS NECK FROM THE CEILING, slowly rotating. 
John barely seems to register this.
JOHN
That’s your phone.
SHERLOCK
Yes, it keeps doing that.
JOHN
(Looks to the hanging man)
So - did you just talk to him for a 
really long time? 
As the man rotates, we see it is a DUMMY.
SHERLOCK
Twenty-three wounds - only was was
lethal. Who struck the lethal blow?
JOHN
Against who?
Offers a clearly ANCIENT TEXT BOOK. ‘THE ASSASSINATION OF 
JULIUS CAESAR’.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
10.


JOHN (CONT’D)
Oh, pressing case then.
John is heading over to the beeping phone, picks it up.
SHERLOCK
They’re all pressing till they’re 
solved.
But John isn’t listening any more. He’s staring at the phone - 
oh no! Oh God!!
INT. TOWER OF LONDON. DAY
15
15
JIM clicks his phone. Finds another App labelled ‘Bank of 
England’. Picture of a piggy bank. Presses it, and -
10010010100111010100101010101101010000011101011110101001...
TIGHT IN on a circuit board again --
INT. BANK OF ENGLAND. DAY
16
16
The BANK DIRECTOR lifts his tea cup to his mouth. But then - 
the floor starts to shake ever so gently - you can only see 
it in the surface of the tea.
BANK DIRECTOR
The vault. That’s the vault.
Spills his tea into his lap.
On his computer screen - a warning flashes up: 
‘BANK VAULT - DOOR 1 OPENING’.
Then ‘DOOR 2 OPENING’.
‘DOOR 3 OPENING’. 
INT. POLICE CAR. DAY
17
17 
LESTRADE and DONOVAN in the back of the squad car, racing 
to Tower Hill. (DONOVAN on the phone.)
LESTRADE
Hacked in? Hacked into the Tower 
of bloody London’s bloody 
security? How?
DONOVAN hands him the phone.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
Tell them we’re already on our 
way.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
11.


DONOVAN
No. Another one. Another break-
in. Bank of England.
On LESTRADE - what!?
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY
18
18
JOHN to SHERLOCK, offers him his phone. 
SHERLOCK
Not now. 
JOHN
(Emphatic)
Sherlock -
SHERLOCK
Not now. Busy.
Something in JOHN’S tone... SHERLOCK looks up - 
JOHN
He’s back.
Hands it to him. Stares at the display. 
‘Come and play. Tower Hill. Jim Moriarty x.’
INT. TOWER OF LONDON. DAY
19
19
JIM rummages in his pocket again. Another plastic aerosol.
He starts spraying something backwards on the glass of the 
jewel case using the aerosol.
Surfs the Apps again -
Finds one labelled ‘Pentonville Prison’. Presses it.
10010011110010011000110100101011001010010001101010101010...
TIGHT IN again on the circuitry, the electrical pulse --
INT. PENTONVILLE. DAY
20
20
The PRISONER GOVERNOR sipping his tea. And then suddenly a 
siren starts to wail. Tea crashes to the floor.
Another WARDER comes running in.
WARDER
Sir! Security’s down, sir. It’s 
failing! The cells are opening.
GOVERNOR
Which block?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
12.


The WARDER looks white. Can’t answer.
GOVERNOR (CONT’D)
Davis. Which block!?
WARDER
All of them.
EXT/INT. CAR. DAY
21
21
Police car speeding along --
Inside - LESTRADE in the back seat, on DONOVAN’S phone.
His phone is ringing now - DONOVAN answers it for him.
LESTRADE
Get a team to the Bank of 
England. Apparently the security 
system in the vault has gone 
down.
LESTRADE hangs up. DONOVAN offers him his own phone.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
What is it now?
DONOVAN
Pentonville Prison. 
LESTRADE
Oh no --
On Donovan: Oh yes! 
INT. JEWEL HOUSE. DAY
22
22
JIM finishes his backwards writing on the glass case. 
Takes the gum out of his mouth - sticks it in the middle of 
the glass. 
And then from his pocket, he takes a little box. He takes 
something from it - delicately, it’s tiny - and sticks it 
into the gum. As he moves away, we close in the gum -
- till we see something sparkling at its centre, a tiny
glittering thing -
On a fire extinguisher being swung back -
- and then Jim slams, with sudden shocking violence into the 
glass right where the diamond is positioned. The glass now 
shattering!
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
13.


INT/EXT. TOWER OF LONDON. DAY
23
23
Police car screams up at the Tower - LESTRADE and DONOVAN 
leap out -
And they run into the Jewel House.
CUT TO:
JIM treading on broken glass - reaches into the jewel case.
CUT TO:
SWAT team with electric screwdrivers, taking the access 
panels off the walls.
LESTRADE
Come on! Open it!
They cut the wires that lead to the vault doors.
The metal screens slide up again. The lasers beams click 
back on. LESTRADE/DONOVAN run into the jewel house. 
And there is JIM... 
Sitting alone, wearing the Crown of England, the Queen’s 
ermined-trimmed robe and carrying the sceptre and orb.
JIM
(Laconic)
No rush.
Music ends.
EXT. TOWER OF LONDON. DAY
24
24
JIM lead away and bundled into a car by UNIFORMED OFFICERS. 
He doesn’t resist. LESTRADE has the Smartphone - turns it 
over in his hand. Dead.
INT. JEWEL HOUSE. DAY
24A
24A
The smashed glass case, the floor glittering with glass. Now 
TAPED OFF - a FORENSICS TEAM picking their way through the 
evidence.
SHERLOCK, JOHN, LESTRADE on the other side of the tape, just 
watching.
LESTRADE
Shouldn’t have been possible. That 
glass, tougher than anything.
SHERLOCK
Perhaps.
His eyes flicks down, as he zeroes in on something.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
14.


Sherlock’s POV. We zoom in on another piece of glitter in 
among all the shattered glass - Jim’s diamond.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(Rounds on Lestrade)
Where is he, where did you take 
him? I want Moriarty!
LESTRADE
Well. It’s mutual.
INT. TOWER OF LONDON. DAY
25
25
Jewel House Security Room.
SHERLOCK, JOHN and LESTRADE. LESTRADE winding back the CCTV 
footage to the point just before JIM smashes the glass. In 
eerie slow motion, the glass re-assembles and for the first 
time we can see the big, black letters the right way round.
GET
SHERLOCK
TO BLACK.
Then FADE UP ON -
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY
26
26
Full-length mirror. SHERLOCK dressing - buttoning up his 
shirt.
CUT TO a second mirror. JOHN doing the same. Suit and tie. 
CUT BETWEEN the two of them, dressing. 
CUT TO:
About to leave 221B. Hand on the door latch.
JOHN
Ready?
SHERLOCK nods. And the open their front door to -
EXT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY
27
27
- REPORTERS. Paparazzi on the front step:
‘Sherlock’. ‘Sherlock’. ‘Sherlock’. ‘This way! This way!’
A POLICEMAN steers them towards an open car door. One of the 
PAPS is waving a Deerstalker. A PAP shouts something like, “ 
Oi. Give us a shot with the hat on!
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
15.


Doors slam shut. And they speed away.
INT. SQUAD CAR. DAY
28
28
SHERLOCK and JOHN in the back of the car. 
JOHN
Remember -
SHERLOCK
Yes.
JOHN
Remember -
SHERLOCK
Yes.
JOHN
Remember what they told you. 
Don’t try to be -
SHERLOCK
No.
JOHN
- clever. Just PLEASE keep it
simple. And brief!
SHERLOCK
God forbid the star witness in 
the trial should come across as 
intelligent.
JOHN
Intelligent - fine. Let’s give 
‘smartarse’ a wide berth.
SHERLOCK
I’ll just be myself.
JOHN
... are you listening to me?
EXT. OLD BAILEY. DAY
29
29
TV crews outside the Old Bailey. JUMP CUT through -
BBC REPORTER
...all hype aside, John, is this 
the ‘Trial of the Century’?
SKY REPORTER
...James Moriarty, accused of 
attempting to steal the crown 
jewels....
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
16.


ITV REPORTER
...conspiring to break into the 
Bank of England...
SKY REPORTER
...massive prison break-out, 
orchestrated by Moriarty...
BBC REPORTER
...arrived here with an 
unprecedented police escort...
ITV REPORTER
...Reichenbach-hero Sherlock 
Holmes in the witness box...
TV graphic - a still from the security camera at the Tower: 
‘GET SHERLOCK’.
INT. OLD BAILEY, CELL BLOCK. DAY
30
30
Clomp clomp clomp. Five pairs of feet. Through the 
catacombs of the Old Bailey.
Four pairs of steel-toe DMs. One pair of Gucci brogues.
ARMED POLICE. Cans of mace and the truncheons swinging at 
their belts. Fully armed. Fully ready.
Wider now to reveal their prisoner - JIM. Handcuffed to two 
of them - one on either side. 
Camera behind as he ascends the wooden stairs that go up to 
the dock. Bubbling gossip as he enters.
The dock constructed like in a Mafia trial - a metal mesh. 
JIM is cuffed to the chair, one each side. Turns to one of 
his captors (the youngest male GUARD).
JIM
(Deadpan)
Would you mind slipping your hand 
inside my pocket?
An icy pause. What the hell is this about?
The GUARD looks at his boss - who nods ‘OK’. And then he 
rummages around in JIM’S trousers. JIM looks at him, 
expressionless, nose to nose.
The GUARD produces a packet of gum. Sighs with relief.
JIM (CONT’D)
Thanks awfully.
Sticks out his tongue to receive the gum.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
17.


INT. OLD BAILEY. TOILETS. DAY
31
31
Running water. SHERLOCK washing his hands. A row of 
porcelain sinks. The public toilets at the Bailey.
In the mirror - there’s a woman at his shoulder. 20s. 
Bright smile. This is KITTY RILEY.
She’s wearing a Deer Stalker. And a home-made ‘SHERLOCK’ 
badge. Oh dear.
KITTY 
You’re him.
SHERLOCK
Wrong toilet.
KITTY
I’m a big fan.
SHERLOCK
Apparently.
KITTY
I read your cases. Follow them 
all. Sign my shirt, would you?
Tugs her jacket open - shirt unbuttoned, full on cleavage. 
Offers him a felt pen. He doesn’t take it.
SHERLOCK
Two types of ‘fans’. 
KITTY
Oh?
SHERLOCK
Catch-me-before-I-kill-again. Type 
A. 
KITTY
Uh-huh. And what’s type B?
SHERLOCK
Your bedroom’s just a taxi ride 
away.
Little laughter. 
KITTY
Guess which I am.
SHERLOCK scans her with lightning speed.
Texts flash on the screen -- ‘PRESSURE MARKS’ -- ‘INK’ -- 
‘POCKET’ -- ‘HEM’ --
SHERLOCK
Neither.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
18.


KITTY
Really?
SHERLOCK
Not a fan at all. Those marks on 
your forearms - 
She has a red line on either forearm.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Edges of a desk. You’ve been 
typing, probably in a hurry. 
Pressing too hard. Under pressure. 
Facing a deadline. 
KITTY
That all?
SHERLOCK
There’s the ink-smudge on your 
wrist. And the bulge in your left 
jacket pocket.
CUT AWAY to the clear outline of a dictaphone in her jacket 
pocket - And then TIGHT IN on the dictaphone itself.
KITTY
Bit of a giveaway?
SHERLOCK
The smudge is deliberate. To see 
if I’m as good as they say I am. 
He takes her hand - examines a black smudge. Sniffs it.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Oil-based. Used in newsprint. But 
drawn with an index finger. 
Examines her other hand. A spot of ink on her index finger.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Your finger.
She laughs. Can’t help it. He really is that good.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Journalist. Unlikely you’d have 
ink from the presses on your 
hand. You put it there as a test. 
KITTY
Wow. I’m liking you. 
SHERLOCK
You mean I’d make a feature. 
‘Sherlock Holmes - the man beneath 
the hat’.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
19.


KITTY
(Smiles, offers her 
hand)
Kitty. Riley. Pleased to meet 
you.
Doesn’t take her hand.
SHERLOCK
No.
(What does he mean?)
Just saving you the trouble of 
asking. ‘No, I won’t give you an 
interview’. ‘No, I don’t want the 
money’.
KITTY
‘You and John Watson. Just 
platonic?’ Can I put you down for 
a ‘No’ there as well?
But SHERLOCK’S leaving. 
KITTY (CONT’D)
(Hungry)
Oh come on. There’s all sorts of 
gossip in the press about you - 
eventually you’re gonna need 
someone on your side. Someone to 
set the record straight.
SHERLOCK
You think you’re the woman for the 
job.
KITTY
I’m smart. And you can trust me. 
Totally.
Finds her business card - pops it in his top pocket.
SHERLOCK
Smart? OK. Investigative 
journalist. Look at me and tell me 
what you see. If you’re so skilful 
you won’t need an interview. You 
can simply read everything you 
need.
Pause. She can’t do what he can do. Her face falls - wounded. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
No? 
(Breath)
OK, my turn. I look at you and I 
can see you’re waiting for that 
first big scoop so your Editor will 
notice you. Expensive skirt. But -
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
20.


On her suit -
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
It’s been re-hemmed twice. Only 
posh skirt you’ve got. 
On her hands, chipped nails - 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
And your nails. You can’t afford to 
have them done that often. I see 
someone who’s hungry. I don’t see 
smart. And I definitely don’t see 
trustworthy. 
He reaches into her jacket pocket - the bulge! - and takes 
out her digital voice recorder. Not trustworthy. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
But I’ll give you a quote if you 
like. Three little words.
Into the digital voice recorder.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
You. Repel. Me.
And he’s gone. Out on KITTY - humiliated, angry.
INT. COURTROOM. DAY
32
32
SHERLOCK in the witness box.  
The PROSECUTING BARRISTER - a plummy woman in her early 40s
- on her feet. The JURY all sit in rapt attention.
JOHN in the gallery, edge of his seat.
PROSECUTING BARRISTER
“A consulting criminal”.
SHERLOCK
Yes.
PROSECUTING BARRISTER
Your words.
SHERLOCK locks eyes with JIM for just a second. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER (CONT’D)
Can you expand on that answer? 
SHERLOCK
James Moriarty is for hire. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER
A tradesman?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
21.


SHERLOCK
Yes.
PROSECUTING BARRISTER
But not the sort who’d fix your 
heating?
SHERLOCK
No. The sort who’d plant a bomb 
or stage an assassination. 
Muttering in the gallery.
PROSECUTING BARRISTER
Would you describe him as...?
SHERLOCK
Leading.
PROSECUTING BARRISTER
What?
SHERLOCK
You’re leading me. Can’t lead the 
witness -
He gestures to the DEFENCE BARRISTER - a young guy. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
He’ll object. And the Judge will 
uphold.
JUDGE
Mr. Holmes - 
SHERLOCK
Ask me ‘how’. ‘How’ would I 
describe him? ‘What opinion have 
I formed?’ Did they not teach you 
this?
JUDGE
Mr. Holmes. We’re fine without
your help. 
PROSECUTING BARRISTER
How would you describe this man? 
His character?
Little smile from SHERLOCK. She took his advice.
SHERLOCK
First mistake. Moriarty’s not a 
man at all. 
Muttering in court.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
22.


SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(Deadly earnest)
He’s a spider. A spider at the 
centre of a web. A criminal web 
with a thousand threads. And he 
knows precisely how every single 
one of them dances.
Is JIM smiling?
PROSECUTING BARRISTER
And how long...?
SHERLOCK
Don’t. Don’t go there. You don’t 
want to ask me that. Bad 
question.
JUDGE
Mr. Holmes!
SHERLOCK
‘How long have I known him?’ Not 
your best line of enquiry. I met 
him twice. Five minutes in total. 
I pulled a gun. He tried to blow 
me up. I felt we had a special 
something.
Murmurs. The witness’ credibility suddenly a little 
suspect.
The JUDGE looks at the DEFENCE BARRISTER - expecting him to 
seize on this. But he does nothing. So -
JUDGE
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously 
claiming this man is an expert? 
After knowing the accused for just 
five minutes.
SHERLOCK
Two minutes would have made me an 
expert. Five was ample.
JUDGE
Mr. Holmes - that’s a matter for 
the jury.
SHERLOCK
Oh. Really?
Oh dear. Here we go. JOHN rolls his eyes.
SHERLOCK looks at the JURY. All taking notes in little note 
pads. 
The screen is suddenly flooded with text - a wealth of 
information describing these twelve people. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
23.


TEACHER -- SECRETARY -- BOND DEALER -- LIBRARIAN --
TIGHT IN. One of them has numbered her pages with a simple 
indexing system. (SHERLOCK reading it upside down!)
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
One librarian - 
TIGHT IN. Two of them have put the date at the top of their 
page and underlined it.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Two teachers - 
TIGHT IN. Two guys who can’t keep their pencils still - 
they twirl them round in their fingers. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Two from high-pressure jobs. 
Bite marks in the pencil ends!
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Probably city.
TIGHT IN. Female FOREMAN writing in shorthand. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
And the Foreman’s a medical 
secretary. Trained abroad judging 
by her short hand.
JUDGE
Mr. Holmes -
SHERLOCK
Seven are married. Two having 
affairs. With each other it would 
seem -
TIGHT IN. Two JURORS sit close with fingers ends touching.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
And they’ve just had tea and 
biscuits. Like to know who ate 
the wafer?
TIGHT IN. Pink biscuit crumbs on a lapel.
JUDGE
Mr. Holmes!
JOHN just hangs his head. It’s all going soooo wrong. The 
press in the gallery are furiously scribbling notes.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
24.


JUDGE (CONT’D)
You’ve been called here to answer 
Miss Sorrel’s questions - not to 
give us a display of your 
intellectual prowess. Keep your 
answers brief and to the point. 
Anything else will be treated as 
contempt. Do you think you could 
survive just a few minutes 
without showing off?
On SHERLOCK - can he?
INT. CELL BLOCK. DAY
33
33
JIM marched back to the cells. Double hand-cuffed. 
And twenty paces behind - SHERLOCK marched there too. In 
contempt of court. 
INT. CELL BLOCK. DAY
34
34
Clang! Clang!
JIM and SHERLOCK. Shut in neighbouring cells. Silence.
JUMP CUT between the two. Listening to the silence. Aware 
that one’s arch-enemy is in the very next room. Every tiny 
movement suddenly eloquent.
Sound of a scraping chair. SHERLOCK sits.
JIM mirrors it perfectly. The same scraping noise. The same 
sitting position. 
Staring at the wall between them. Just the sound of their 
breathing.
HOLD...
INT. CELL BLOCK. DAY
35
35
SHERLOCK signing for his things. JOHN paid Sherlock’s fine.
JOHN
What did I say? I said don’t get 
clever.
SHERLOCK
It’s not something I can turn on 
and off like a tap.
(Beat)
Well?
JOHN
Well, what?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
25.


SHERLOCK
You were up in the gallery. You 
saw the whole thing - start to 
finish.
JOHN
Like you said it would be. Sat on 
his backside. Never even stirred.
FLASHBACK. The courtroom. JIM’S DEFENCE BARRISTER. Not 
moving. Glued to his seat.
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
Moriarty’s not mounting any 
defence.
And they sweep out -
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT
36
36
Returning to Baker Street - cameras clicking. 
Door slams. MRS. HUDSON pokes her head out. A new outfit 
and very bold make-up. Most glam we’ve ever seen her.
MRS. HUDSON
Saw you on the telly. John looked 
smart.
SHERLOCK
Lipstick?
MRS. HUDSON
In case they catch me through a 
window. Don’t want to do a 
Cherie.
JOHN and SHERLOCK whistle past her, trudge upstairs.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT
37
37
JOHN drops into his chair. SHERLOCK paces.  
JOHN
Ok. Ok. 
(sighs)
Bank of England; Tower of London; 
Pentonville. Three of the most 
secure places in the country. Six 
weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in. No-
one knows how or why. All we know 
is...
SHERLOCK
He ended up in custody.
SHERLOCK looking meaningfully at JOHN. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
26.


JOHN
Don’t do that.
SHERLOCK
What?
JOHN
The look. 
SHERLOCK
Look?
JOHN
You’re doing the look again.
SHERLOCK
I can’t see it, can I?
Pushes him in front of the mirror.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
It’s my face.
JOHN
And it’s doing a ‘thing’. You’re 
doing a ‘We-both-know-what’s-
really-going-on-here’ face.
SHERLOCK
We do!
JOHN
No. I don’t. Which is why I find 
the face so annoying.
SHERLOCK
If Moriarty wanted the jewels 
he’d have got them - if he wanted 
those prisoners freed they’d be 
out on the streets. The only 
reason he’s sitting in a cell 
right now is because he chose to 
be there. Somehow this is part of 
his scheme.
And something catches his eye.
A spider. In 221B. It has made a little web above the 
bookcase.
INT/EXT. HOTEL. DAY
38
38
Early morning. Plush London hotel. 
Inside - an ARMED POLICEMAN knocking on doors. One by one 
the JURY emerge from their hotel rooms. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
27.


Fleeting shot through an open door - the hotel information 
service on the TV. 
INT. COURTROOM. DAY
39
39
Court is in session. JOHN in the gallery.
The JUDGE enters and sits. Hush. Addresses the DEFENCE 
BARRISTER.
JUDGE
Mr. Crayhill? Can we have your 
first witness?
The young DEFENCE BARRISTER clambers to his feet.
DEFENCE BARRISTER
Your Honour. We’re not calling 
any witnesses.
An icy pause. 
JUDGE
I don’t follow. You’ve entered a 
plea of ‘Not guilty’.
DEFENCE BARRISTER
Nevertheless - my client is 
offering no evidence. The defence 
rests.
And he sits. Lots of murmuring.
JIM turns for the very first time and looks straight at 
JOHN. Gives him a polite smile. It’s meant for SHERLOCK.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY
40
40
SHERLOCK, in his dressing gown, lies on the sofa, staring 
at the ceiling.
Imagining the JUDGE’S summing up - guessing the content, 
with a great deal of accuracy.
SHERLOCK
Ladies and gentlemen of the 
Jury...
INT. COURTROOM. DAY
41
41
The JUDGE’S summing up.
JUDGE
James Moriarty stands accused of 
multiple counts of attempted 
burglary...
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
28.


JUMP CUT BETWEEN the two.
SHERLOCK
...crimes which, if he is found 
guilty, will illicit a very long 
custodial sentence. And yet... 
JUDGE
...his legal team has chosen to 
offer...
SHERLOCK
...no evidence whatsoever to 
support their plea.
JUDGE
I find myself in the unusual 
position of recommending a 
verdict wholeheartedly. 
SHERLOCK
You must find him ‘Guilty’.
JUDGE
...’Guilty’.
INT. OLD BAILEY, CORRIDOR. DAY
42
42
The JURY marched to their green room by their POLICE 
escorts. 
An OFFICER locks them in with a computer key card and hangs 
it around his neck. Two ARMED POLICE stationed outside.
A clock on the wall: ‘10.44am’. Tick tick tick.
INT. OLD BAILEY - ATRIUM. DAY
43
43 
JOHN outside the courtroom. Sits alone. Just the tick tick
tick of his watch. ‘10.50am’.
The CLERK OF THE COURT comes out.
CLERK OF THE COURT
Coming back...
JOHN
Already?
JOHN glances at his watch.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Six minutes.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
29.


CLERK OF THE COURT
Surprised it took ‘em that long to 
be honest. There was a queue for 
the loo. 
INT. COURTROOM. DAY
44
44
The JURY file into court again.
CUT TO:
The FOREMAN stands.
CUT TO:
The CLERK OF THE COURT addresses her.
CLERK OF THE COURT
Have you reached a verdict on 
which you are all agreed?
The FOREMAN opens her mouth, and...
HARD CUT TO:
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY
45
45
SHERLOCK on the sofa - eyes closed.
His phone buzzes beside him. He was expecting this call. 
EXT. STREET. DAY
46
46
JOHN in the street. 
JOHN
Sherlock? 
SHERLOCK
What happened?
JOHN
‘Not guilty’.
SHERLOCK
Yes. Of course.
JOHN
You were right. No defence. And 
yet they just let him walk free. 
Moriarty’s disappeared. You think 
he might come and try to find 
you?
SHERLOCK hangs up. Beeeep. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
30.


JOHN (CONT’D)
Sherlock? Sherlock? You still
there?
INT/EXT. 221B BAKER STREET/STREET. DAY
47
47
SHERLOCK puts the phone down. Sloooowly. 
Goes to the kitchen. Kettle. Fills it from the tap. On the 
details - running water, flicking switch, steam rising.
CUT TO:
JOHN - dialling his mobile again. ‘Scotland Yard’.
CUT TO:
SHERLOCK opens a cupboard and takes out two cups and 
saucers, tea pot, milk jug. The best tea service.
Laying the tea tray. For two. He’s expecting company.
CUT TO:
JOHN on the mobile.
JOHN
Lestrade? John. Look - I’m worried. 
Jim’s back on the streets -
CUT TO:
SHERLOCK walks back into the lounge with the tray - puts it 
down on the side table. Pours two cups. 
Takes out his violin and starts to play - 
A BACH SONATA for solo violin. (g minor)
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - HALL. DAY
48
48
The hall at 221B is dark and shadowy - 
Someone fiddles with the latch, and then it opens. It’s 
JIM. We can just make him out in the dark.
Softly closes the door. He can hear SHERLOCK playing.
Starts to climb the stairs - his feet barely making any 
sound on the stair carpet. Step step step --
And then the violin suddenly stops. SHERLOCK knows he is 
coming.
JIM falters for a second. And then the violin begins again - 
so he carries on walking.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
31.


INT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY
49
49
JIM pushes open the door. SHERLOCK stops. Doesn’t turn.
SHERLOCK
Most people knock. 
(Beat)
But then you’re not most people I 
suppose. Kettle’s just boiled.
JIM
You’re not going to finish your 
tune? Johann Sebastian Bach would 
be appalled. 
Indicates the chair.
JIM (CONT’D)
May I?
SHERLOCK
Please.
JIM
(Sits)
Do you know, when he was on his 
death bed - Bach - he heard his 
son at the piano playing one of 
his ditties? The boy stopped 
before he got to the end and... 
SHERLOCK
...the dying man jumped up, rushed 
to the instrument and finished it.
JIM
Couldn’t cope with an unfinished 
melody.
SHERLOCK
Neither can you. That’s why 
you’ve come.
JIM
Be honest - you’re just a tiny 
bit pleased.
SHERLOCK
With the verdict?
JIM
With me, back on the streets. You 
need someone to play with - to 
test you. And every fairy-tale 
needs a good old-fashioned 
villain. 
Fruit bowl - JIM selects the reddest apple of all and 
starts to polish it on his lapel.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
32.


JIM (CONT’D)
You need me, or you’re nothing. 
Because we’re just alike, you and 
I. Except you’re boring. You’re on
the side of the angels
SHERLOCK
You got to the jury, of course.
JIM
I got into the Tower Of London. 
You think I can’t worm my way 
inside twelve hotel bedrooms?
Takes SHERLOCK’S pen-knife to peel the apple.
SHERLOCK
Ah... Cable network.
JIM
Every hotel bedroom has a 
personalised TV screen.
FLASHBACK.
FOREMAN in her hotel room, eating room service.
TV control in hand. Scrolling through a menu: ‘Ms. 
WILLIAMS, WELCOME TO THE WESTHAMPTON HOTEL INFORMATION 
SERVICE.’
JIM (V.O)(CONT’D) 
And everyone has a pressure 
point.
A photo of the woman’s kids suddenly flashes up on screen. 
And a personalised message from MORIARTY -
‘IF YOU WANT YOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN TO STAY BEAUTIFUL THEN 
FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS...’
JIM (CONT’D)
Someone that they want to protect 
from harm. Easy-peasy.
Back to 221B -
SHERLOCK
So. How are you going to do it? 
Burn me?
JIM
I told you how. The final 
problem. Have you worked out what 
it is yet?
On Sherlock. He doesn’t know. Hates that.
Jim, grins, expectant.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
33.


JIM (CONT’D)
Come on, Sherl. What’s the final 
problem? I did tell you, honest. 
But did you listen??
Sherlock - impassive. Because, damn it, he doesn’t know.
JIM starts to drum with his fingers on the edge of the 
chair - And odd irregular rhythm -
Da - dada - da - da- dadadah - da - dada - da!
And then suddenly stops. 
JIM (CONT’D)
How hard do you find it, Sherlock - 
having to say “I don’t know.”?
SHERLOCK
I don’t know.
JIM
Oh, that was clever. That was quite 
clever actually. Speaking of 
clever, have you told your little 
friends yet?
SHERLOCK
Told them what?
JIM
Why I did it. Why I broke into all 
those places and never took 
anything?
SHERLOCK
No.
JIM
But you understand?
SHERLOCK
Of course.
JIM
On you go then.
SHERLOCK
You want me to tell you what you 
already know?
JIM
I want you to prove that you know 
it. Can’t trust anyone, can you?
SHERLOCK
You didn’t take anything because 
you didn’t need to. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
34.


JIM
Good.
SHERLOCK
You’ll never need to take anything   
again.
JIM
Very good. Because?
SHERLOCK
Because nothing in the Bank of 
England - or the Tower of London - 
could possibly equal the value of a 
key that could open both. 
JIM
(Smiles)
Bingo. I can open any door, 
anywhere. With a few tiny lines of 
computer code. No such thing as a 
private bank account now - they’re 
all mine. No such thing as secrecy. 
I own secrecy. Nuclear codes? I 
could blow up NATO in alphabetical 
order. In a world of locked rooms, 
the man with the key is King. And, 
honey, you should see me in a 
crown.
SHERLOCK
You were advertising.
JIM
And you were helping.
SHERLOCK
The whole trial. You were just 
showing the world what you can do.
JIM
(Waves his new mobile)
Big client list here. Rogue 
Governments; terror cells; 
intelligence community. They all 
want me, Sherlock - suddenly I’m 
Mr. Sex!
SHERLOCK
If you can break any bank, what do 
you care about the highest bidder?
JIM
I just like to watch them all 
competing. “Daddy’s brought a treat 
home.” Aren’t ordinary people 
adorable? 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
35.
(MORE)


Well, you know - that’s why you’ve 
got John. I should get a live-in 
one, it must be so funny.
A silence. Sherlock just staring. Never quite getting the 
measure of this man.
SHERLOCK
Why are you doing all this? Money 
doesn’t interest you, power doesn’t 
really - what’s it all for?
JIM
To solve the problem, Sherlock. Our  
problem. The final problem.
Siren.
JIM (CONT’D)
Right on queue. Flatfoot breaks 
the mood.
SHERLOCK starts striding to the window. Jim’s voice stops 
him.
JIM (CONT’D)
It’s going to start very soon now, 
Sherlock - the fall. But don’t be 
scared. Falling’s just like flying, 
except there’s a destination. 
SHERLOCK
Never liked riddles.
JIM
Learn to. Because I owe you a fall, 
Sherlock Holmes. I. Owe. You.
Voices from outside. Sherlock looks out the window.
Sherlock’s POV. LESTRADE climbing out of his squad car. 
Running out. JOHN with him. 
Turns. JIM’S gone. The lamp in the kitchen swinging - the 
door to the bedroom banging. He’s gone out the back, down 
the fire escape. LESTRADE bursts in. JOHN behind.
LESTRADE
Moriarty...?
SHERLOCK shakes his head. Picks up the apple. MORIARTY has 
carved three letters in it with the knife:
‘IOU’.
EXT. 221B ROOF. DAY

SCENE IS CUT.

JIM (CONT'D)


Fade to BLACK.
CAPTION: ‘TWO MONTHS LATER’.
EXT. STREET. DAY
51
51
Cashpoint.
JOHN queuing at a busy ATM. Finally it’s his turn. Puts his 
card in and punches his pin.
Unusually long pause. Then a personal message on the 
screen:
‘There is a problem with your card. Please wait a moment.’
JOHN rolls his eyes. Pause.
‘A member of staff will be with you shortly.’
‘Thank you for your patience, John.’ ‘JOHN’??? 
Just behind him a familiar black car pulls up in the 
street.
EXT. STREET. DAY
52
52
Pall Mall.
JOHN in the back of the black car. It pulls up outside a 
London club.
A brass plate - ‘The Diogenes Club’. See JOHN’S reflection 
in it as he scuttles up the steps.
INT. DIOGENES CLUB. DAY
53
53
A sea of leather chairs, wood panelling and coffee tables. 
Occupied by a host of men, mostly in chalk pin-stripe
suits.
JOHN looks for someone - can’t see him. So he approaches a 
GENTLEMAN at the nearest table.
JOHN
Er... excuse me? Mycroft Holmes?
The gentleman blanks him. Merely stares at his paper.
JOHN (CONT’D)
(Whispers this time)
Do you know if Mycroft Holmes is 
about?
The gentleman rustles his paper but again totally ignores 
John.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
37.


JOHN (CONT’D)
Can you not hear me?
People are getting up out of their chairs and peering over 
at him, scandalized.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Anyone know Mycroft Holmes? I’ve 
been asked to meet him here.
The gentleman turns and scowls at John, the full thunder of 
the British Establishment etched on his furious face! Then he 
presses a bell on the wall. No sound comes from it.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Am i invisible? HELLO!
The muffled sound of running feet. LIVERIED MEN come racing 
in. Their shoes are covered in cloth! 
JOHN (CONT’D)
What!? I was just asking. 
They try to put their hands over his mouth to stop him 
talking, then drag him away, loudly protesting.
The Gentleman returns to his paper and sips a glass of 
whiskey, satisfied that order has been restored.
INT. DIOGENES CLUB. DAY
54
54
A second room - the Strangers’ Room. 
JOHN and MYCROFT - JOHN straightening his clothes after his 
brush with the staff.
MYCROFT
Tradition, John. Our traditions 
define us.
JOHN
Total silence is traditional, is 
it? 
JOHN
You can’t even say...‘Pass the 
sugar’?
MYCROFT
Three quarters of the diplomatic 
service and half of the 
Government front bench all 
sharing one tea trolley? It’s for 
the best, believe me. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
38.


He stares into space for a moment. Shudders.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
We don’t want a repeat of 1971.
MYCROFT leads him to a table by the fire - 
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
We can talk here.
A glass of whisky and a newspaper already there. JOHN 
glances at the paper - a red top.
JOHN
You read this stuff? 
MYCROFT points at the side bar -
MYCROFT
Caught my eye.
‘EXCLUSIVE IN SUNDAY’S PAPER - SHERLOCK: SHOCKING TRUTH 
ABOUT HERO SLEUTH’.
It’s written by KITTY RILEY. (Picture in the byline).
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Sunday. They’re doing a big 
expose.
JOHN
Love to know where she got her 
information.
MYCROFT points to the sub-heading: ‘CLOSE FRIEND RICHARD 
BROOK TELLS ALL’.
MYCROFT
Someone called Brook. Recognise 
the name?
JOHN
(Doesn’t)
School friend maybe.
MYCROFT
(Amused)
Of Sherlock’s?
MYCROFT takes the paper and folds it away.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
But that’s not why I asked you 
here.  
He takes out a cardboard folder - pulls out a photo. A man. 
Stern face. Grim features. Tattooed neck.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
39.


JOHN
Who’s this?
MYCROFT
You don’t know him?
JOHN
No.
MYCROFT
Never seen his face before?
JOHN
Um...
Maybe he is a bit familiar.
MYCROFT
He’s taken a flat in Baker 
Street. Two doors down from you.
JOHN
(Joking)
I was thinking of doing a drinks 
thing for the neighbours...
MYCROFT
I’m not sure you’ll want to. 
Hands JOHN the rest of the file.
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
Sulejmani. Albanian hit squad. 
Expertly-trained killer. Living 
less than twenty feet from your 
front door.
JOHN
Great location. Jubilee line’s 
handy.
MYCROFT
John... 
JOHN
What’s it got to do with me? I 
didn’t ask him to move in, did I?
MYCROFT hands JOHN a second file. Another photo - a woman.
MYCROFT
Dyachenko. Ludmila. 
JOHN
Hang on. I think I have seen - 
(her)
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
40.


MYCROFT
(Shakes his head)
Russian killer. Taken the flat 
opposite.
JOHN
OK. Sensing a pattern here.
Offers two more files.
MYCROFT
In fact - four top international 
assassins re-locate to within 
spitting distance of 221B. 
(Beat)
Anything you’d like to share with 
me?
JOHN
I’m moving. 
MYCROFT
Not hard to guess the common 
denominator, is it? 
JOHN
It’s not Moriarty.
MYCROFT
He promised Sherlock he would 
come. 
JOHN
If it was Moriarty then we 
wouldn’t be here talking. I’d 
already be dead. Sherlock too.
MYCROFT
If not Moriarty then whom...? 
JOHN
Why not talk to Sherlock, if 
you’re so concerned for him?
Knows the answer before he even asked.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Oh yeah. Don’t tell me.
MYCROFT
Too much history between us, 
John. Old scores, resentments...
JOHN
Pinched all his Smurfs? Broke his 
action men?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
41.


MYCROFT
I know you want to protect him. 
From the ‘slings and arrows of 
outrageous fortune’. Is that the 
Doctor in you, I wonder? Or 
something else. The solider’s 
weakness. Hero worship.
JOHN
Are we done?
Gets up to go.
MYCROFT
We both know what’s coming, John. 
Moriarty is obsessed. He’s sworn 
to destroy his only rival. 
JOHN
You want me to watch out for your 
kid brother - because he won’t 
accept your help?
MYCROFT
(Icy smile)
If it’s not too much trouble.
EXT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY

JOHN arrives back at Baker Street -
Looks at the faces in street - do any of them look like 
terrorists or assassins? Commuters and tourists. 
Suddenly everyone seems suspicious.
CUT TO:
Crosses the road to 221B. The front door is wide open and a 
TRADESMAN is trudging in and out with flat pack boxes. MRS. 
HUDSON’S new kitchen.
JOHN smiles at him, then stares down at the mat. There is a 
red envelope there. Not addressed. Is it for them?
Picks it up gingerly - rips the top open.
Inside - it is filled with bread crumbs. What???
A big handful of bread crumbs! They slip between his 
fingers and fall to the floor. 
A pigeon arrives and starts to peck them.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY

JOHN
Sherlock? Something weird -
Goes into the flat. LESTRADE and DONOVAN are here, plus a 
JUNIOR OFFICER - 
JOHN (CONT’D)
What’s going on?
SHERLOCK
Kidnapping. 
LESTRADE
Rufus Bruhl. The Ambassador to 
the U.S.
JOHN
(Confused)
Isn’t he in Washington? 
LESTRADE
Not him. His children.
JOHN
What?
LESTRADE
(Reading from notes)
Max and Claudette. Seven and 
nine. 
DONOVAN shows them a photo. Angelic children.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
They’re at St. Aldate’s.
DONOVAN
Posh boarding place down in 
Surrey.
LESTRADE
School broke up. All the other 
boarders went home. Just a few 
kids remained - including those 
two.
DONOVAN
The kids have vanished.
LESTRADE
The Ambassador’s asked for you 
personally. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

DONOVAN
(Unimpressed)
The Reichenbach hero.
Different POV -
For the final seconds of the scene a black and white grainy 
picture. POV corner of the room behind the cobweb.
Is there a hidden camera up there?
EXT. BAKER STREET. DAY
56A
56A
JOHN and SHERLOCK climbing into a police car.
SHERLOCK
How was Mycroft?
JOHN confused - how does he know? From the smell...
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Leather polish. Stale whisky. 
(Gestures to the street)
He was asking about our new 
neighbours.
JOHN
You already know.
SHERLOCK
I know that there are four sets 
of curtains that are closed in 
broad daylight. ‘Who’s behind 
them?’ is the interesting 
question, though.
JOHN looks up - sure enough, four sets of curtains are 
closed - four separate flats in the street. 
Closer on Sherlock as he looks up at them -
- and then frowns - something else!
Some graffiti on a section of wall - woven into it, quite 
clearly if you look, three letters: I.O.U.
On Sherlock - alive to this now, fascinated.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Here we go!
JOHN
Sorry, what?
SHERLOCK
Nothing. Nothing.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
57
57 
Sign: ‘ST. ALDATE’S PREPARATORY SCHOOL.’ ‘7-13. DAY AND 
BOARDING.’
Long gravel drive, rolling grounds. Hockey nets. Scrum
machine. Plenty of money flying around.
A handful of UNIFORMED POLICE combing the grounds.
CUT TO:
SHERLOCK, JOHN, LESTRADE, DONOVAN, JUNIOR OFFICER running 
up the steps.
MISS MACKENZIE is a mousey little Scottish Schoolmistress. 
Pale, distressed, weeping into her handkerchief, seated.
A POLICEMAN offers her tea and blanket - the usual routine.
LESTRADE
(Whispers)
Miss MacKenzie, House-mistress. 
Go easy. 
SHERLOCK
Miss MacKenzie. You’re 
responsible for pupil welfare. 
And yet you left this place wide 
open last night. Are you an 
idiot, or a drunk, or a criminal.
The WOMAN - utter shock. SHERLOCK now just yanks her 
blanket off.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Now, quickly, tell me!!
MISS MACKENZIE
(Blurts it all out)
All the doors and windows were 
properly bolted. The atrium is 
monitored by 24 hour CCTV. Noone - 
not even me - went to their room 
last night. You have to believe  
me.
SHERLOCK’S expression suddenly softens.
SHERLOCK
(Suddenly smiley)
I do. I just wanted you to speak 
quickly.
(As he sweeps in)
Miss MacKenzie needs to breathe 
into a bag now.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

INT. SCHOOL, CORRIDOR. DAY
59
59
A tour of the rooms.
Everywhere cold and empty now that the children have gone. 
In the corridor - a row of big old laundry baskets.
INT. DORMITARY. DAY
60
60
A Victorian-style dormitary. Four girls. 
Three of them have left for the Christmas vacation. Empty 
cupboards swing open on their hinges. Bare notice boards. 
Drawing pins in rectangular patterns. 
CLAUDIE BRUHL’S bed is the only one with bed-clothes still 
on it - crumpled from where they’ve been slept in. 
A lonely-looking teddy bear tucked in the top.
Three pairs of shoes lined up. Five blouses in the 
cupboard. Five skirts. Five pairs of regulation socks. 
SHERLOCK opens the trunk -
Inside it - some children’s fiction - stuff a seven year-
old girl would read. ‘POPPY LOVE’ and ‘BALLET SHOES’. 
Something stuck in a red envelope. SHERLOCK retrieves it - 
JOHN does not see.
A compendium of Grimm’s Fairy Tales SHERLOCK lets it fall 
open at the chapter headings... 
Reads. Frowns. Shuts the trunk.
SHERLOCK
Show me where the brother slept.
INT. DORMITARY. DAY
61
61
Similar room. Four beds. Three of them stripped - the 
fourth recently slept in.
Three pairs of boy’s shoes. Five shirts. Five pairs of 
trousers etc...
Some boy’s fiction - spy mysteries, mainly. A cricket bat 
with a bottle of linseed oil.
SHERLOCK examines the dormitary door. An old wooden door 
with a frosted glass panel. 
He opens it - studies the light outside. Watches as the 
light casts the shadow of his hand on to the glass.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
46.


SHERLOCK
Boy sleeps in that bed every
night - gazing at the only light 
source, out in the corridor. He 
would know every shape, every 
outline - the silhouette of 
everyone who stood outside his 
room.
LESTRADE
OK. So...?
SHERLOCK
So someone approaches his door - 
someone whose shape he didn’t 
recognise. An intruder. 
FLASHBACK - the intruder’s silhouette.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
And the person has his sister 
beside him - maybe he can even 
see the outline of a weapon. 
Makes a gun shape with his fingers - the shadows fall.
CUT between the shape of SHERLOCK (with fingers!) and the 
FLASHBACK to the real intruder.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
What would he do? He’d have only 
a few precious seconds - before 
they came into the room. 
Runs to the bed - lies on it. Pretending to be the boy.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
How would he use them? If not to 
cry out?
Leaps up again, goes to the books on the shelf.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
This little boy, this particular 
little boy, who reads all these spy 
books ... what would he do?
Picks up the cricket bat - sniffs it, deep breaths. But it 
doesn’t smell. Sniffs the air. Shakes the bottle of linseed, 
half-empty. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Get Anderson.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

INT. DORMITARY. DAY (INC. DIALOGUE & ACTION FROM SC. 63) 
62 
Ultra-violet lights on stands. Forensics - lead by ANDERSON 
- pulling curtains, taping blackout material across the  
skylights.
The room becoming darker and darker. On SHERLOCK and JOHN 
as they pass deeper into shadow...
...and finally blackness.
LESTRADE
No sign of blood. Why the ultra-
violet?
SHERLOCK
Linseed oil. 
The door slams shut. Total blackout.
Click. On goes to ultra-violet.
And there, on the wall, written in splashes of oil from the 
bottle... a giant message picked out in ultra-violet.
HELP US
A message left by the ten year-old MAX BRUHL.
The UV glow picking out SHERLOCK’S profile.
ANDERSON
(Sighs)
Not much use. Doesn’t lead us to 
the kidnapper.
SHERLOCK
Brilliant, Anderson. 
ANDERSON
Really? 
SHERLOCK
Yes. Brilliant impression of an 
idiot.
(Points)
Floor!
Camera pans down - There, on the floor: UV footprints. 
The boy poured a pool of oil on the ground as well, so that 
the intruder trod in it. And there are his foot marks, 
plain as day. 
Along side those of two children. An eerie echo of what 
went on.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
48.


SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
The boy was made to walk ahead of 
him. 
Examining MAX BRUHL’S footprints. No heel?
JOHN
On tip-toe?
SHERLOCK
Indicates anxiety. Probably with 
the gun at his head. The girl was 
held beside him. Dragged 
sideways. Probably means he had 
his left arm cradled about her 
neck.
ANDERSON
(at the door)
That’s the end of it. We don’t 
know where they went from here. 
Tells us nothing, after all.
SHERLOCK
Right, Anderson. Nothing at all. 
Expect his shoe size, his height, 
his gait, his walking pace. 
Lights click on.
JOHN
Having fun?
SHERLOCK
Starting to. 
JOHN
(Whispers)
Maybe don’t do the smiling. 
Kidnapped children.
CUT TO:
SHERLOCK kneels on the floor, takes a petri dish from his 
pocket and starts to scrape the surface of the parquet.
INT. CAB. DAY

JOHN and SHERLOCK in a cab.
JOHN
How did he get past the CCTV? If 
all the doors were locked... 
SHERLOCK
He walked in when they weren’t 
locked.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
49.


JOHN
A stranger can’t just walk into a 
school like this.
SHERLOCK
Anyone can walk anywhere if they 
pick their moment. Yesterday, the 
last day of term. Parents milling 
around, chauffeurs, staff. What’s 
one more stranger among that lot?
FLASHBACK. Parents come to collect their kids. Kissing them 
‘Hello’. Lugging out suitcases.
Camera follows a dark figure through the throng. We do not 
see his face...
SHERLOCK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
All he had to do was find a place 
to hide.
FLASHBACK -
The corridor. Right outside the room is the laundry basket.
EXT/INT. BART’S LABORATORY. DAY
65
65
Establishing shots of BART’S. 
CUT TO:
SHERLOCK comes striding through the doors of Bart’s lab, 
JOHN in his wake.
MOLLY is there, putting on her coat.
SHERLOCK
Molly!
MOLLY
Oh, hello. I’m just on my way 
out.
SHERLOCK
No. You’re not.
Steers her back into the room.
MOLLY
I’ve got a lunch date.
SHERLOCK
You’ll need to cancel it. Having 
lunch with me. 
Digs two packets of Quavers out of his pockets.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
50.


SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Need your help, and in fairness I 
must tell you - it’s one of your 
old boyfriends we’re trying to 
track down. Been a bit naughty.
JOHN
You think this is Moriarty?
SHERLOCK
Of course it’s Moriarty.
MOLLY
Sorry - er, actually Moriarty was 
never my boyfriend. We went out 
three times. I ended it.
SHERLOCK
Yes. And then he stole the crown 
jewels, broke into the Bank Of 
England, and organised a prison 
break at Pentonville. For the sake 
of law and order, Molly, I think 
it's best if you avoid all future 
attempts at a relationship.
She is horrified. He steers her back into the room and opens 
her bag of crisps.
INT. BART’S LABORATORY. DAY
66
66 
MOLLY struggling under a huge weight of folders - 
scientific journals - puts them on the lab bench for 
SHERLOCK to read.
SHERLOCK is engaged with a microscope - scraping a tiny 
pinch of powder on to a slide. 
SHERLOCK
The oil, John.
JOHN
What?
SHERLOCK
The oil in his footprints. All 
the chemical traces on his shoe 
have been preserved. The sole of 
the shoe is like a passport. If 
we’re lucky can see exactly what 
he’s been up to.
Myriad coloured grains under the microscope. (White, grey, 
red, green, brown.)
JUMP CUT through a sequence of experiments as SHERLOCK and 
MOLLY struggle to identify the parts of the compound. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
51.


Bubbling flasks and dripping pipettes.
SHERLOCK starts to compile a handwritten list of the 
compound elements as he recognises them...
On Molly watching him. Rapt, so lost him in.
CUT TO:
Experiment one yields a white residue in a test tube. 
Molly, helping, doing a litmus test.
MOLLY
Alkaline.
Sherlock writes:
Chalk (cretaceous)
SHERLOCK
Thanks, John.
MOLLY
Molly.
SHERLOCK
Yes.
CUT TO:
Experiment two. This one centres on the grey grains, spun 
in a centrifuge machine. Examines the texture of the 
residue.
Writes:
Asphalt
CUT TO:
Experiment three. Fine red grains, reacting to a chemical 
spray. John watching this time.
On Molly watching them two of them work together. Maybe the 
tiniest frown.
Writes:
Brick dust (1950’s)
CUT TO:
Four. Tiny green particles fizzing in a jar.
Writes:
Vegetation (2 types) - Rhododendron flower
CUT TO:
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
52.


The final part of the compound is brownish and oily. And 
here SHERLOCK is completely stuck.
Writes:
???
Adds more and more question marks all the time.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Some sort of glycerol molecule. 
What are you?
CUT TO:
MOLLY now watching Sherlock closely. She is frowning, 
serious. (We can see John some distance away, his back to 
us, working at something - not part of this conversation.) 
MOLLY
... What did you mean ... IOU?
Sherlock looks up at her sharply. What?
MOLLY (CONT’D)
You said IOU. You were sort of 
muttering when you were working.
SHERLOCK
... Nothing. Mental note.
He resumes working. Molly looking at him thoughtfully. 
Summons the courage for another blurt.
MOLLY
You know, you’re a bit like my Dad. 
He’s dead. No, sorry...
SHERLOCK
Molly, please don’t feel obliged to 
make conversation - it’s really not 
your area.
MOLLY
But when he was dying, he was 
always so cheerful, he was lovely. 
Except when he thought no one could 
see. I caught him once, he looked 
so sad. 
SHERLOCK
Molly -
MOLLY
You look sad -
(Glances at John)
- when you don’t think he can see.
Sherlock: caught off-guard. What?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
53.


MOLLY (CONT’D)
Are you okay, and don’t say you 
are, because I know what it means - 
looking sad, when you think no one 
can see you.
SHERLOCK
You can see me.
MOLLY
I don’t count. 
That floors him for a moment. Too honest, too true. On Molly,  
now in a blurty rush:
MOLLY (CONT’D)
And what I was going to say, if 
there’s anything I can do, anything 
you need at all, you can have me. 
No! I mean, I just mean - please. 
If there’s anything you need ... 
it’s fine.
Blushing furiously now, staring at the floor.
SHERLOCK
... What would I need from you?
MOLLY
I don’t know, but you should 
probably say thank you, actually.
SHERLOCK
... thank you.
MOLLY
And now I’m going to get more 
crisps, do you want anything, it’s 
okay, I know you don’t.
And off she goes, a picture of humiliation. On Sherlock: 
almost guilt.
SHERLOCK
Actually, maybe I could -
MOLLY
I know you don’t!
And she’s walking away, bit too fast, feet rattling across 
the floor.
She passes behind John we hold on him. 
JOHN studying the forensic photographs of the kids’ rooms - 
Looks hard at the picture of the girl’s dormitary. A 
photograph of the contents of the trunk. The red envelope - 
inside it the book of fairy tales.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
54.


And it hits him -
JOHN
Sherlock!
John, crossing to Sherlock now...
JOHN (CONT’D)
That envelope - in her trunk. 
There’s another.
SHERLOCK
What?
JOHN
Identical. Left on our doorstep. 
I found it today.
Where did he put it? It’s stuffed in his jacket pocket.
Compares it to the envelope in the photograph. Two red
envelopes. 
JOHN hands SHERLOCK the envelope. Looks inside it - sees 
traces of -
SHERLOCK
Bread crumbs?
JOHN
Uh-huh. They were there when I 
got back.
SHERLOCK
A trail of bread crumbs...? And a 
little book of Fairy Tales...?
FLASHBACK - SHERLOCK looking at the book, studying it at 
the school.
Chapter heading... ‘SNOW WHITE’, ‘ASCHPUTTEL’, ‘HANSEL AND 
GRETEL’
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Two children, taken out into the 
forest by a wicked father, 
following a little trail of bread 
crumbs.
JOHN
(Dawns on him)
Hansel and Gretel! 
FLASHBACK -
A man’s hand leaving the book in the trunk --
The same man’s hand leaving the bread crumbs on the 
doorstep --
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
55.


JOHN (CONT’D)
What sort of kidnapper leaves 
clues?
SHERLOCK
The Jim sort. The sort that likes 
to boast. The sort that treats it 
like a game. He sat in the flat. 
Said these exact words to me...
FLASHBACK. JIM at 221B.
JIM
Every fairy-tale needs a good old-
fashioned villain.
TIGHT IN on the red apple.
Back to present -
SHERLOCK’S face changes. EUREKA! Suddenly knows what he’s 
missing.
SHERLOCK
The fifth substance! It’s part of 
the fairy tale. The witch’s 
house.
JOHN
What?
SHERLOCK
The glycerol molecule.
(Staring at the 
microscopic compound)
PGPR.
JOHN
What’s that?
SHERLOCK
Used in making chocolate.
INT. DARK ROOM. DAY
68
68
Candlelight - illuminating sweetie wrappers, coloured foil, 
gold and silver. The sound of chewing and gorging.
Camera sweeps across the room, through the shadows, passes 
a locked door.
All over the floor - bag and bags of sweets.
And the shadows of two children. Eating.

SHERLOCK walks into the Incident Room at Scotland Yard - 
the place is buzzing. 
Lestrade shows them a fax.
LESTRADE
Fax arrived, an hour ago.
Says:
“Hurry up - they’re dying”
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
What have you got for us?
SHERLOCK produces the list he wrote -
SHERLOCK
We need to find a place in or 
around the city where these five 
things intersect.
On the list, the chemicals on the kidnapper’s shoes:
Chalk (cretaceous)
Asphalt
Brick dust (50’s)
Vegetation (2 types)
Chocolate
TIGHT IN on ‘Chocolate’.
LESTRADE
What the hell is this? 
‘Chocolate’??
SHERLOCK
I think we’re looking for some 
sort of disused sweet factory.
LESTRADE clicks his fingers and his JUNIOR OFFICER goes 
scuttling off to surf the web.
TIGHT IN on ‘Asphalt’.
LESTRADE picks up the list.
LESTRADE
Asphalt?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
57.


SHERLOCK
No good. Not specific enough. 
TIGHT IN on ‘Chalk (cretaceous)’
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Chalk, though - chalky clay - 
that’s a very thin band of 
Geology.
CUT AWAY to an imaginary map of London in SHERLOCK’S mind.
A big coloured stripe for the chalky geology.
TIGHT IN on ‘Brick dust’
LESTRADE
Brick dust.
SHERLOCK
Building site. Bricks from the 
1950’s. 
LESTRADE
There’s thousands of building 
sites in London!
SHERLOCK
I’ve got people out looking.
LESTRADE
So have I!
His phone pings. Someone has texted him a picture of a 
building site.
And then it pings again. Another! And another! And another!
LESTRADE sprints over to the computers to urge them on.
SHERLOCK looks carefully at the photos. 
Again we flash to the imaginary map in his mind - the 
various building sites start to appear on it as coloured
dots.
CUT TO:
On the clock - time passing - 
LESTRADE and his team hammering away on the internet, 
trying to find sweet factories and building sites -
SHERLOCK’S phone pings again. Gazes at it.
SHERLOCK
John. Look at this one. 
Rhododendron ponticom. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

TIGHT IN on ‘Vegetation’.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Exactly the same type of 
vegetation.
On the imaginary map - highlights one of the building sites 
in a new colour. All the shaded area coincide.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
(Immersed in his mind 
map)
Addlestone. 
LESTRADE

SHERLOCK
There’s a mile of disused 
factories between the river and 
the park. Matches everything.

Dusk light.
An big ugly 1950s factory building. A sign says ‘DRAYTON

Hansel and Gretel.

Torches shine across a disused factory floor - machinery, 
laced with cobwebs. Linger on the cobwebs.
The dancing beams pick out details - machines; a stack of 
old crates stamped with the names of chocolate bars.
A torch finds the foot of a staircase. Travels up the dusty 
stairs to -
An upper gallery. A door.
CUT TO:
SALLY DONOVAN searching through the scrubland.
CUT TO:
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

Door crashing open - kicked down by the JUNIOR OFFICER. 
Wooden splinters.
They all shine their torches inside. It’s a disused 
accounting office. Broken furniture. 
There is a strange metallic glare from one corner. The 
floor is absolutely littered with sweet wrappers!
SHERLOCK
Fed them sweets. 
No-one here. A few candles in a saucer burned down.
SHERLOCK puts his hand over them.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Alight thirty minutes ago.
A broken floorboard. The gap looks just big enough for a 
child to squeeze through.
Air is coming through. A tiny strand of fibre caught on a 
nail, blowing in the breeze. White fibre. School shirt.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Hansel and Gretel got away.
CUT TO:
Scrubland. SALLY DONOVAN peering through the darkness. She 
swears she can hear something moving - rustling.
CUT TO:
SHERLOCK examines the sweet papers. Lifts one to his face - 
sniffs it. And then licks it. Eeuugh!
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Mercury.
LESTRADE
What? 
SHERLOCK
The papers. Painted with mercury. 
Lethal. The more of the stuff 
they ate...
JOHN
It was killing them.
SHERLOCK
Not enough to kill on it’s own, but 
taken in large quantities - 
eventually it would have killed 
them. He didn’t have to be there 
for the execution. He could be a 
thousand miles away. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

Murder by remote control. The 
hungrier they got, the more they 
ate, the faster they died. Neat!
JOHN
Sherlock!
CUT TO:
The sobbing louder and louder. SALLY peers through the 
darkness with her torch and -
Sees something in the trees. On her face.
DONOVAN
Oh my God.
Two little children. A BOY and a GIRL. Faces smeared with 
chocolate and toffee.
The BOY lying in his sister’s lap. Is he unconscious?

DONOVAN
Right, then. The professionals

SHERLOCK and JOHN on their way out. He stops them.

Remember. She’s in shock. And 
she’s seven years-old. Anything

Yep. Might be helpful.

SHERLOCK, JOHN, LESTRADE, DONOVAN enter the interview room.
CLAUDIE RUHL - a SOCIAL WORKER holding her hand and

SHERLOCK (CONT'D)


CLAUDIE looks up.... And starts screaming. 
Screaming. Screaming. Screaming. Utterly hysterical.
Points at SHERLOCK and screams for her life. Wild and 
uncontrollable. Something about him...
LESTRADE
(To Sherlock)
Out. Get out!
SHERLOCK quickly ushered away.
On Donovan, watching him go. She looks between Claudie and 
Sherlock - what was that? What??
INT. SCOTLAND YARD. NIGHT

LESTRADE’S office. SHERLOCK/JOHN/LESTRADE/SALLY DONOVAN 
Through the internal windows - small groups of OFFICERS 
gossiping in corners about what just happened. 
SHERLOCK silent - standing with his back to the others, 
staring out of a window. Frowning, haunted.
JOHN
Doesn’t make any sense.
LESTRADE
Kid’s traumatised. Something 
about Sherlock reminded her of 
the kidnapper.
On Sally. She’s also deep in thought - but registers what 
Lestrade just said, and glances towards -
- Sherlock, standing at the window.
Closer on Sherlock. He doesn’t turn, but his eyes flick to:
Donovan, reflected in the window in front - staring at his 
back, appraisingly.
As she glances away, we roll focus -
- to see a row of three darkened windows in the building 
opposite. And painted on each a letter, spelling out I.O.U.
Sherlock now staring. Neck-prickling moment. Behind him the 
conversation has been continuing.
JOHN
What’s she said?
LESTRADE
Hasn’t uttered another syllable.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
62.


JOHN
And the boy?
LESTRADE
(Shakes his head)
Unconscious. Still in intensive 
care.
On Sherlock, staring at those letters -
- and it is that a shadowy figure moving in the room beyond.
LESTRADE drags him from his reverie.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
Well. Don’t let it get to you. I 
always feel like screaming when you 
walk into a room. In fact, so do 
most people.
He starts leading the way out. Sherlock makes to follow, but 
Donovan - still at the table - speaks up.
DONOVAN
Brilliant work, you did. Finding 
those kids, from just a footprint. 
Really amazing.
SHERLOCK
Thankyou.
He makes to the door.
DONOVAN
Unbelievable.
Sherlock hesitates in the doorway - then, without turning to 
look at her, just heads on.
As he clears frame, we’re left with a shot of the three I O U 
windows across the street. A man standing at the central 
window, staring through the oval of the O.
EXT. STREET. DAY

JOHN and SHERLOCK haling a CAB. 
JOHN
You okay?
SHERLOCK
Thinking.
(Hailing cab)
This is my cab - you get the next 
one.
JOHN
Why?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
63.


SHERLOCK
You might talk.
He’s already climbing into the cab ...
INT. SCOTLAND YARD, INCIDENT ROOM. NIGHT
76
76
DONOVAN enters the incident room. Shuts the door. Switches 
on the light.
The evidence still spread across the table - the note in 
SHERLOCK’S handwriting - the five chemicals traces.
We can see the cogs turning in her mind. A voice from the 
door -
- LESTRADE, standing there.
LESTRADE
Problem?
INT. CAB. DAY
76A
76A
SHERLOCK, in the back of the cab, lost in his own thoughts, 
dark and so troubled. There’s light flickering on his face, 
he glances towards it ...
Sherlock’s POV. It’s one of the cabs with a telly. The sound 
is turned down, but it’s some kind of Jackanory-style kids 
show. There are illustrations of Knights in armour, fighting 
dragons, and there’s a STORY-TELLER sitting in a big chair.
SHERLOCK
(To the CABBIE)
Could you turn that off, please?
But the CABBIE, talking away on the phone, not listening.
Irritated, Sherlock’s eyes flash back to the screen -
- and now he’s staring.
On screen: closer on the storyteller on the screen - it’s JIM 
MORIARTY.
Sherlock, now scrabbling to find the volume control ...

LESTRADE, DONOVAN.
DONOVAN
A footprint, that’s all he had. A 
footprint.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
64.


LESTRADE
Well you know what he’s like - 
CSI Baker Street. 
DONOVAN
Our boys couldn’t have done it. 
LESTRADE
That’s why we need him. He’s 
better.
DONOVAN
That’s one explanation. 
LESTRADE
What’s the other?
INT. CAB. NIGHT
80
80
SHERLOCK just staring at the screen - the impossible 
screen. JIM talking away from his storyteller’s armchair
JIM
(On screen)
Sir Boast-A-Lot was bravest and 
cleverest Knight at the round 
table. But soon the other Knights 
grew tired of all his stories, 
about brave he was and how many 
dragons he’d slain. And soon some 
of them even began to wonder if all 
Sir Boast-A-Lot’s stories were 
true...
On Sherlock’s face - what? What??
INT. SCOTLAND YARD. INCIDENT ROOM. NIGHT
81
81
LESTRADE and DONOVAN.
DONOVAN
Only he could have found that 
evidence. And then the girl 
screams her head off when she 
sees him. A man she’d never seen 
before. Unless she had seen 
before.
LESTRADE
What’s your point?
DONOVAN
You know what my point is. You just 
don’t want to think about it!
Lestrade’s mobile rings. He answers.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
65.


LESTRADE
Lestrade.
Covers the phone. 
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
(Whispers to Donovan)
Chief Super. Talk later.
She turns on her heel, starts stalking out.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
(Into phone)
Sir?
As he listens, his eyes drift to all the evidence. Over this 
we hear JIM’S STORYTELLING VOICE (perhaps even inter-cutting 
with his face on the screen.)
JIM
And so a Knight went to Arthur, and 
told him they didn’t believe all 
Sir Boast-A-Lot’s stories. And 
after a while even the King began 
to wonder...
We have now close in on Lestrade’s troubled face.
INT. CAB. NIGHT
81A
81A
On JIM’s on screen.
JIM
But that wasn’t the end of Sir 
Boast-A-Lot’s problem. No, that 
wasn’t the final problem.
And the screen clicks off, because -
- the cab has stopped. The driver has already slammed down 
the window, awaiting payment.
SHERLOCK
What was that?
He’s now tearing out of the cab -
EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
81B
81B 
- and racing round to the driver’s window.
SHERLOCK
What was it -
And he realises - the Cab Driver is Jim Moriarty!!!
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
66.


JIM
No charge!
And he roars off, taking off at top speed.
Sherlock, racing after him now, doesn’t see -
- a car coming towards him fast! The DRIVER texting
someone, not noticing SHERLOCK. 
SHERLOCK is about to be hit with the full force. The car 
rushing at him, and then - 
Someone steps out of nowhere and saves him.
He lies there on the pavement with his rescuer - a burly 
SHAVEN-HEADED MAN with a tattooed neck. Lying right on top 
of SHERLOCK in the street. 
Slowly they dusk themselves off and stand. 
SHERLOCK
Thank you. 
SHERLOCK clasps his hand warmly.
And as he does the SHAVEN-HEADED MAN suddenly gets shot in 
the back -
Twice! 
No three times! 
From three different directions! Bang bang bang.
He slumps into SHERLOCK’S arms, bleeding. 
What the hell just happened here?
JOHN
(Calling from off)
Sherlock?
John, climbing out another cab now racing towards him.
INT. SCOTLAND YARD, INCIDENT ROOM. NIGHT

Darkness. DONOVAN at a computer.
She’s playing the CCTV tape of CLAUDIE RUHL. In the movie 
SHERLOCK enters the room and she starts to scream. Scream 
scream scream. 
Freeze frame on her screaming face.
And then a knock at the door. ANDERSON enters.
ANDERSON
Got your text.

DONOVAN
Something I need you to see.
EXT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT
84

SHERLOCK and JOHN. 
Blue light flashing - ambulance taking the body away. JOHN 
recognises the tattoo on the neck of the dead man.
JOHN
Sulej - something. Sulejmani. 
That was it. Mycroft showed me 
this whole big fat file. Albanian 
gangster living two doors down 
from us. 
SHERLOCK
He died because I shook his hand.
JOHN
What?
SHERLOCK
Saved my life, but couldn’t touch 
me. Why?
Jumps up and heads back to the flat, JOHN scuttling after -
INT. 221B BAKER STREET, HALL. NIGHT
85

SHERLOCK runs in excited, JOHN after.
SHERLOCK
Four assassins living on our 
doorstep. They haven’t come here 
to kill me. They have to keep me 
alive!
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT
86
86
SHERLOCK runs in - sits down in front of his laptop.
SHERLOCK
I’ve got something that they ALL 
want. But whoever approaches 
me...
JOHN
(Realises)
...the others kill him before he 
can get it.
SHERLOCK and JOHN at the computer - checking the wifi
networks list. ‘New networks available.’
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
68.


Some of them have names in other languages: Russian, 
Albanian, Czech...
SHERLOCK
There’s a surveillance web, 
centring on us right now.
JOHN
What have you got that’s so 
important?
On SHERLOCK. No idea.
He runs his finger across the table and stares at the layer 
of dust...
Dust...
SHERLOCK
We need to ask about the dusting.
On JOHN - what??
SCENE 87 CUT

DONOVAN and ANDERSON - come to see LESTRADE together.
LESTRADE
No! No way.
ANDERSON
Just hear Sally out, would you?
DONOVAN
He saved them in the nick of 
time. Covered himself in glory. 
LESTRADE
You’re not seriously suggesting 
he’s involved?
ANDERSON
I think we have to entertain the 
possibility. 
(Lestrade about to 
protest)
It was a set up. He abducted 
those kids. Left the whole trail 
of evidence.
LESTRADE
He’s solved dozens of cases for 
us in the past! Why would he 
stage a hoax one?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
69.


ANDERSON
Got an image to maintain.
She tosses a newspaper across to him. KITTY’S by-line. 
‘EXCLUSIVE IN SUNDAY’S PAPER - SHERLOCK: SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT 
HERO SLEUTH’.
‘CLOSE FRIEND RICHARD BROOK TELLS ALL’.
DONOVAN
We have to question him at least. 
Beat. LESTRADE breathes deeply.
LESTRADE
OK. I’ll do it.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT
89
89 
SHERLOCK and MRS. HUDSON are doing an inventory of the 
dusting - examining every nook and cranny. 
SHERLOCK
Precise details. The last week. 
What’s been cleaned?
MRS. HUDSON
Well, Tuesday I did your lino.
SHERLOCK
No. Here. This room. This is 
where we’ll find it. Any breaks 
in the dust layer. They can put 
back anything but dust. Dust is 
eloquent.
A knock at the door. JOHN goes to answer.
MRS. HUDSON
(To John)
What’s he on about?
JOHN shrugs.
SHERLOCK
Cameras. We’re being watched.
MRS. HUDSON
What?? There’s cameras here? I’m 
in my nightie. 
He thinks he’s found one... the top bookshelf. Something has 
wiped the dust away. Eureka! A little camera up there.
POV camera. SHERLOCK up close, playing with it.
JOHN appears with LESTRADE.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
70.


SHERLOCK
No, Inspector.
LESTRADE
What?
(CONT’D)
(CONT’D)
SHERLOCK
‘No’. That’s the answer.
LESTRADE
You haven’t heard the question.
SHERLOCK
You want me to come down to the 
station. Just saving you the 
trouble of asking.
LESTRADE
Sherlock...
SHERLOCK
The scream.
LESTRADE
Yes, look...
SHERLOCK
Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was 
Donovan. ‘Am I somehow 
responsible for the kidnapping?’
Oh, Moriarty’s smart. He put that 
doubt in her head. That little 
nagging sensation. You’ll have to 
be strong to resist it. 
LESTRADE
Look -
SHERLOCK
A man who could corrupt a jury. 
Making a girl scream was amateur 
hour. He’s got inside your heads. 
Clever, clever. How can you kill 
an idea? You can’t. Not once it 
makes a home there. 
LESTRADE
Will you come? 
SHERLOCK
One photograph. That’s the next 
move. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
71.


LESTRADE
What?
SHERLOCK
Moriarty’s game. First the 
scream. Then I’m photographed 
being taken in for questioning. 
He wants to destroy me inch by 
inch. He’s going to turn me into 
a fraud, probably using the 
press. 
On JOHN - genuine concern.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
It’s a game, Lestrade. And it’s 
not one I’m willing to play. Not 
when I’ve got a proper mystery on 
my doorstep.
Hits a button on his laptop - he’s managed to hack into the 
signal from the surveillance camera. 
The screen shows them all standing there right now.
EXT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT

LESTRADE leaving the building. Climbs into his car.

JOHN peeping out of the curtains at the car below. It 
drives off.
SHERLOCK at the computer - trying to hack into more 
surveillance cameras.
SHERLOCK
He’ll be deciding.
JOHN
Deciding?
SHERLOCK
Whether to come back with a 
warrant and arrest me. 
JOHN
You think?
SHERLOCK
Standard procedure.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
72.


JOHN
You should have gone with him.
People will think...
SHERLOCK
I don’t care what people think.
JOHN
You’d care if they thought you 
were stupid or wrong.
SHERLOCK
No, that just means that they’re
stupid or wrong doesn’t it?
JOHN
Sherlock! I don’t want the whole 
world believing you’re --
SHERLOCK
What? That I’m what?
JOHN
A fraud.
Beat.
SHERLOCK
You’re worried they’re right.
JOHN
What?
SHERLOCK
You’re worried they’re right 
about me.
JOHN
No!
SHERLOCK
That’s why you’re so upset. You 
don’t even want to entertain the 
possibility. You’re afraid that 
you’ve been taken in as well.
JOHN
No! No way.
SHERLOCK
Moriarty’s playing with your mind 
too. Can’t you see what’s 
happening?
Silence. An uncomfortable stand-off.
JOHN
I know you’re for real. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

SHERLOCK
A hundred per cent?
JOHN
Yes. Nobody could fake being such 
an annoying bastard all the time.
A little smile from SHERLOCK.
INT. SCOTLAND YARD, CHIEF SUPER’S OFFICE. NIGHT
92
92 
LESTRADE, DONOVAN, ANDERSON in with the CHIEF SUPER. He 
leans back in his chair, frowning.
CHIEF SUPER
Sherlock Holmes?
LESTRADE
Yes, sir.
CHIEF SUPER
That bloke who’s been in the 
press?
LESTRADE
Mm-hm.
CHIEF SUPER
I thought he was just some sort 
of... Private Eye.
LESTRADE
He is.
CHIEF SUPER
But we’ve been consulting him? 
That’s what you’re telling me?
(Lestrade nods)
We haven’t been using him for 
any... proper cases though, have 
we?
An eloquent pause.
CHIEF SUPER (CONT’D)
I mean we haven’t let him near 
any crime scenes, or anything.
LESTRADE
One or two...
ANDERSON
(Mutters)
Or twenty or thirty.
CHIEF SUPER
(Explodes)
What?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
74.


LESTRADE
(Like a guilty child)
I wasn’t the only senior officer 
who did it! Gregson called him in 
for that triple murder. Even let 
him take some of the evidence 
home with him.
CHIEF SUPER
So. An amateur detective given 
access to all sorts of classified 
information. And now he’s a 
suspect in a case. Do you have 
any idea how this looks?? 
LESTRADE
Sir...
CHIEF SUPER
You bloody idiot, Lestrade. Bring 
him in. Right now. 
(They don’t move)
Do it!
CUT TO:
Corridor. LESTRADE, ANDERSON, DONOVAN leaving side by side.
LESTRADE
Proud of yourselves?
ANDERSON
What if it’s not just this case? 
What if he’s done this to us 
every single time?
They hurry out to arrest SHERLOCK. LESTRADE hangs back and 
dials his mobile.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT
93
93
JOHN hangs up his phone. 
JOHN
Still got some friends on the 
force. Lestrade. Says they’re all 
coming over here right now. 
They’ll be queuing up to slap on 
the handcuffs - every single 
officer you’ve ever made feel 
like a tit. Which is a lot of 
people.
Knock at the door. MRS. HUDSON.
MRS. HUDSON
Oo-ooh. Sorry. Am I interrupting?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
75.


(CONT’D)
MRS. HUDSON
Some chap delivered a parcel. I 
forgot. Marked perishable. I had 
to sign.
Offers them a padded envelope. A red padded envelope.
MRS. HUDSON (CONT’D)
Funny name. German. Like the 
fairy tales.  
SHERLOCK stares at JOHN. They both know the significance. 
Grabs the note from MRS. HUDSON and studies it. 
SHERLOCK rips it open.
Inside - a gingerbread man. Over-done. Blackened at the 
edges.
SHERLOCK
Burnt to a crisp.
JOHN
What’s it mean?
Bang bang bang on the door. MRS. HUDSON runs down to 
answer.
Blue lights flashing at the windows. The POLICE have come.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT
94
94
LESTRADE leading the team. Speaking with no enthusiasm. MRS 
HUDSON is in tears.
LESTRADE
Sherlock Holmes. I’m arresting 
you on suspicion of abduction and 
kidnapping.
JOHN loses it big time as they try to drag his friend away.
JOHN
Sherlock...
SHERLOCK
It’s alright. 
JOHN
No way, it’s ridiculous...
LESTRADE
Get him downstairs. Now.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
76.


JOHN tries to intervene.
LESTRADE (CONT’D)
Don’t try to interfere or I’ll 
arrest you too.
And SHERLOCK is dragged downstairs. JOHN left in the room 
with SALLY DONOVAN. 
Silence. And then...
DONOVAN
I said it. First time we met.
JOHN
Don’t...
DONOVAN
Solving crime won’t be enough. 
One day he’ll cross the line. Ask 
yourself: what kind of man would 
kidnap those kids, just so he 
could impress us all by finding 
them. 
Door opens. The CHIEF SUPER walks in. Come to survey the 
scene. Doesn’t see JOHN behind him.
CHIEF SUPER
Donovan.
DONOVAN
Sir.
CHIEF SUPER
Got our man.
DONOVAN
Yes, sir.
CHIEF SUPER
Looked like a bit of a weirdo, if 
you ask me. Often are, these 
vigilante types. 
Studies the flat - the skull on the mantelpiece. Grunts 
contemptuously. 
John is glaring at him.
CHIEF SUPER (CONT’D)
What are you looking at? 
EXT. 221B BAKER STREET. NIGHT
95
95
SHERLOCK outside by the police van. Armed support unit - 
the CHIEF SUPER has pulled out all the stops for this 
arrest, just as JOHN predicted.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
77.


The front door opens and JOHN is bundled out.
SHERLOCK
Joining me?
JOHN
Uh-huh. Apparently it’s against 
the law to chin the Chief 
Superintendent.
A POLICEMAN handcuffs them together
The CHIEF SUPER comes out with a handkerchief pressed to 
his lip.
SHERLOCK
Bit awkward this.
JOHN
Mm. No-one to bail us out.
SHERLOCK
I was thinking more about our 
imminent daring escape.
Did JOHN just hear that correctly?
JOHN
What?
SHERLOCK reaches into the open POLICE CAR (JOHN too, 
because they’re cuffed together) and turns up the volume on 
the radio unit. There is a spare ear-piece on the dashboard 
- he holds it next to the speaker.
All the ARMED OFFICERS (wearing ear pieces) suddenly cringe 
in pain - the feedback is deafening. 
SHERLOCK grabs a gun turns it on them.
SHERLOCK
Ladies and gentlemen. If you 
could all please kneel.
All the officers turn and stare - LESTRADE, DONOVAN, THE 
CHIEF SUPER. 
SHERLOCK pulls back the trigger.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Now would be good.
They all comply.
JOHN
Just so you’re aware - the gun is 
his idea. I’m just - you know...
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
78.


SHERLOCK
My hostage.
JOHN
Yeah. OK. Hostage works. 
Whispers to SHERLOCK.
JOHN (CONT’D)
What happens now?
SHERLOCK
I do what Jim wants. Become a 
fugitive. 
EXT. STREET. NIGHT
96
96
SHERLOCK and JOHN running through the back alleys. Cuffed 
together so they have to hold hands.
JOHN
(Breathless)
Now they’ll definitely talk.
EXT. STREET. NIGHT
97
97
JOHN and SHERLOCK running through the city at night, 
darting through the shadows, cuffed together - 
SHERLOCK scrabbles over a fence - 
JOHN
Sherlock, wait.
But he won’t wait. He dives over the fence fast and they’re 
left hanging there, one either side, face to face.
JOHN (CONT’D)
We’re going to need to 
coordinate.
CUT TO:
They sink down in an alley, panting. A police car zooms 
past - searching for them.
SHERLOCK
(Whispers)
Everyone wants to believe it. 
That’s what makes it so clever - 
a lie that’s more appealing than 
the truth. All my brilliant 
deductions were a sham. No-one 
feels inadequate. Sherlock’s just 
an ordinary man. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
79.


JOHN
What about Mycroft? He could help 
us.
SHERLOCK
Big family reconciliation - not 
really the moment.
JOHN thinks he spots someone in the shadows.
JOHN
Sherlock - there’s someone behind 
us.
SHERLOCK
Yes.
JOHN
In the shadows. The police have 
found us.
SHERLOCK
It’s not the police. They 
couldn’t get a tail on us that 
fast. It’s one of our new 
neighbours from Baker Street. 
Well, maybe he’ll give us some 
answers...
And he darts from the shadows, dragging JOHN with him.
JOHN
Where are we going?
SHERLOCK
We’re jumping in front of that 
bus.
Drags JOHN up and they run into a busy road. They are caught,  
side by side, in the headlights of an oncoming double decker. 
Suddenly a DARK MAN sprints from the shadows - all dressed 
in black, hooded.
He grabs them, pulls them back to the pavement.
SHERLOCK seizes the opportunity - reaches into the MAN’S 
jacket and pulls out a gun. Aims it straight at him.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
What is it that you want from me? 
Cocks the trigger.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Tell me.
DARK MAN
He left it at your flat.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
80.


SHERLOCK
He?
DARK MAN
Moriarty.
SHERLOCK
What?
DARK MAN
The computer key code.
Beat.
SHERLOCK
Of course. He’s selling it. The 
programme that he used to break 
into the Tower. He planted it 
when he came over.
Gunshot!
Someone has just shot the DARK MAN in the back. Two shots. 
They see a police car coming and make a run for it again.
EXT. STREET. NIGHT
98
98
SHERLOCK and JOHN at a late-night Kebab van.
SHERLOCK
A game changer - the ultimate key 
- it can break into any system.
And it’s sitting in our flat
right now.
FLASHBACK -
‘GET SHERLOCK’ written in big black letters on the glass of 
the Tower of London.
SHERLOCK (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
That’s why he wrote the message - 
telling everyone where to come. 
Get Sherlock!
FLASHBACK -
JIM sitting with his apple at 221B.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
We have to get inside the flat 
and search. 
JOHN
CID will be camped out.
(Breath)
Why plant it on you?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
81.


SHERLOCK
Another subtle way of smearing my 
name - now I’m best pals with all 
those criminals.
A news van drops a stack of papers outside a doorway. 
Another advert for KITTY’S story.
JOHN
Seen this?
Rips the page out.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Kiss and tell. Some bloke called 
Brook. Rich Brook. Who is he? 
SHERLOCK as if he has suddenly been hit over the head.
JOHN (CONT’D)
I don’t think you’ve ever 
mentioned him.
EXT/INT. SUBURBAN STREET/FLAT. NIGHT
99
99
Car parking in a suburban street. A woman jumps out and 
locks it - KITTY.
Goes to her front door - raises the key to the lock but the 
door swings open of its own accord. OMG! Someone has broken 
in to her flat.
She pushes the door gently - it creaks open - and peers 
inside. No sign of anyone. No evidence of a disturbance.
Into the lounge - switches on the light.
SHERLOCK and JOHN are sitting there in the darkness - still 
handcuffed.
SHERLOCK holds the business card she gave him.
SHERLOCK
Too late to go on the record?
INT. FLAT. NIGHT
100
100
SHERLOCK/KITTY/JOHN. In KITTY’S flat.
She has given them a hairpin - SHERLOCK releases the 
handcuffs.
SHERLOCK
Congratulations. The truth about 
Sherlock Holmes. Everybody wanted 
the scoop and you got it. Bravo. 
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
82.


KITTY
I gave you your opportunity. I 
wanted to be on your side, 
remember? You turned me down. So -
SHERLOCK
I did. And then - lo and behold! - 
someone else turns up to spill 
the beans. How utterly 
convenient. Who is Brook?
She shrugs: ‘Dunno’.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Oh come on, Kitty. You don’t 
trust a voice on the end of a 
telephone. There were furtive 
little meetings in cafes. There 
were sessions in hotel rooms 
where he gabbled away into your 
dictaphone.
Her silence is assent - SHERLOCK is quite right.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
How did you know you could trust 
him? A man turns up with the Holy 
Grail in his pocket. What were his 
credentials?
Behind them, the front door bangs. And coming into the room, 
with bags of shopping is -
Jim Moriarty! (But different - different accent, different 
voice, different manner.)
JIM
Couldn’t get any ground coffee, so 
I got some instant - I prefer 
instant, don’t you?
He sees John and Sherlock, jolts to a halt, drops the 
shopping.
JIM (CONT’D)
Oh my God!
JOHN
... Moriarty?
JIM
(Rounds on Kitty)
You said he wouldn’t find me - you 
said I’d be safe here.
KITTY
You are safe, Richard. I’m a 
witness, he wouldn’t harm you in 
front of witnesses.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
83.


JOHN
What, he’s her source? Moriarty?
He’s Richard Brook?
KITTY
Of course he’s Richard Brook - 
there is no Moriarty, there never 
has been.
JOHN
... what? Sorry, what?
On Sherlock - impassive, this is worse than he thought.
Kitty has picked up a copy of Spotlight, tosses it to John.
KITTY
Look him up - in Spotlight. Rich 
Brook. An actor Sherlock Holmes 
hired to be Moriarty.
JIM
Dr. Watson, I know you’re a decent 
man. Please don’t hurt me. 
JOHN
You’re Moriarty. We met remember - 
you were going to blow me up!!
JIM
I’m sorry. He paid me, I was out of 
work, needed the money, I’m sorry.
JOHN
Sherlock, explain - I’m not getting 
it.
KITTY
Oh, I’ll be doing the explaining - 
in print.
Tosses him a copy of her story - a proof of what will be in 
the paper.
KITTY (CONT’D)
It’s all there. Conclusive proof. 
You invented James Moriarty - 
your nemesis. 
JOHN
Invented him??
KITTY
Mm-hm. You invented all the 
crimes, actually - and to cap it 
all you made up a master villain.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
84.


JOHN
That’s -! Don’t be so bloody 
stupid. 
KITTY
Ask him! He’s right here, just ask 
him. Tell him, Richard.
JOHN
For God’s sake. This man was on 
trial!
KITTY
Yes. 
(to Sherlock)
And you paid him. Paid him to take 
the rap. Promised you’d rig the 
jury. Not exactly a West End role, 
but I’ll bet the money was good. 
(Grins)
But not so good he didn’t want to 
sell his story.
JIM
I’m so sorry. I really am
JOHN looks between them - utterly amazed.
SHERLOCK
And that’s what you’re publishing 
on Sunday? That’s the big 
conclusion of this story. 
Moriarty is an actor? 
JIM
But you know I am. I can prove it. 
Kitty show them.
She opens a folder on her laptop - A folder of articles about  
BROOK. 
Birth certificate, CV, reviews of plays that he’s been in! 
(Can we have some pictures of JIM in tights playing Hamlet?) 
JIM has really done a thorough job inventing himself.  
JIM (CONT’D)
(To John)
You must have seen me - I was on 
that kids show, I was the 
storyteller. It’s on DVD. 
He points to a picture from the Storyteller show.
JIM (CONT’D)
(To Sherlock)
Sherlock, just tell him - it’s all 
coming out anyway, it’s all over.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
85.


On Sherlock - a flash of anger in those eyes, now stepping 
forward to Jim.
Jim cowers back, truly frightened.
JIM (CONT’D)
Don’t you hit me. Don’t you dare 
lay a finger on me!!
SHERLOCK
Enough of this. Stop it, stop it 
right now!
Jim, staring at him, appalled but fascinated.
JIM
Jesus, look at you. It’s like you 
think it’s all real. Just how mad 
are you?
KITTY
Mad enough to invent his own super-
villain, so he could look good.
(to John)
Dr. Watson, please just think about 
it. An arch-enemy? A master 
criminal? How real does any of this 
seem to you? Who’s the one man who 
could make this stuff up?
On John - almost like he’s rocked for a moment. Then -
Jim is bolting for it, racing down the hall, slamming into 
the bathroom. Sherlock, racing after him.
Doors locked! Kicks it once, twice. The door slams open.
Jim is gone. John leaps towards the window, Sherlock holds 
him back.
SHERLOCK
He’ll have back-up
Kitty is behind them in the hallway.
KITTY
You know what, Sherlock Holmes - I 
look at you now and I can read you. 
And - You. Repel. Me.
Sherlock, striding past her now!

JOHN
Can he do it? Change his whole 
identity.
Close on Sherlock’s face. He blinks, thinking, memory 
slamming into his mind.
FLASH: Jim, on the screen in cab.
FLASH: Jim, as the cabbie.
FLASH: the distant figure of JIM staring through the oval of 
the O on the window.
FLASH: Sherlock in Baker Street, turning to see the Jim has 
vanished.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Make you the criminal.
SHERLOCK holds the copy KITTY has given him.
SHERLOCK
He’s got my whole life story. 
That’s how you sell a big lie - 
you wrap it in truth to make it 
palatable.
JOHN takes it, reads.
JOHN
It’ll be your word against his.
SHERLOCK
Which is why he’s spent twenty-
four hours sowing doubts in 
people’s minds. The only thing to 
make his game complete would 
be... 
Freezes - deep in thought. Eyes wide. He’s just realised 
how this is going to end.
JOHN
Sherlock?
SHERLOCK
Go home. There’s something I need 
to do.
JOHN
What? Can I help?
SHERLOCK
No. Go home.
And he’s walking off into the night.

MOLLY finishing her shift - very late.
Hangs up her coat in her locker. And she becomes aware that 
she’s not alone. There’s someone in the shadows, watching. 
She stiffens in utter fright.
MOLLY
Who’s that? Who’s there?
That familiar voice.
SHERLOCK
You’re wrong, you know. You do 
count.
Sherlock Holmes, stepping from the shadows.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
You have always counted and I have 
always trusted you. But you were 
also right. I’m not okay.
MOLLY
Tell me what’s wrong. 
SHERLOCK
Molly ... I think I’m going to die.
Beat. She remembers their conversation from before.
MOLLY
What do you need?
Sherlock: stepping closer. His face, pained, troubled.
SHERLOCK
If I wasn’t everything you think I 
am ... everything I think I am ... 
would you still want to help me?
MOLLY
(A beat)
What do you need?
A silence. Another step closer.
SHERLOCK
You.

Very late, dim lights. MYCROFT arrives in the Strangers 
Room at the Club. Sits down at his regular place and -
JOHN is there waiting for him, in the high-backed chair.
MYCROFT
John!
JOHN hands MYCROFT the proof of KITTY’S story.
Long pause whilst MYCROFT reads.
JOHN
She’s really done her homework, 
Miss Riley. Stuff that only 
someone close to Sherlock could 
know. 
MYCROFT
Ah.
JOHN
Have you checked your brother’s 
address book lately? Two names. 
Yours and mine. And Moriarty
didn’t get this stuff from me.
So...
MYCROFT
(Hears the accusation)
John...
JOHN
How does your relationship work? 
You two get together for a coffee 
now and then? You and psycho boy? 
MYCROFT
Now, John...
JOHN
Your own brother! Your only
brother. And you blab about his 
whole bloody life to that maniac!  
MYCROFT
I never intended... I mean, I 
never dreamed...
JOHN
This - this is what you were 
trying to tell me, isn’t it? 
‘Watch his back. Because I’ve 
made a mistake’. 
(Beat)
How d’you meet him?
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011
89.


MYCROFT
People like James Moriarty. We 
watch them. We know about them.
The most dangerous criminal mind 
the world has ever seen. And in his 
pocket - the ultimate weapon too.
A key code - a few lines of 
computer code that can unlock any 
door. 
JOHN
You abducted him - to try to get 
the key code.
MYCROFT
Interrogated him for weeks. 
JOHN
And?
MYCROFT
He wouldn’t play along. Just sat 
there - staring into the 
darkness.
FLASHBACK to JIM in a cell, surrounded by men in grey suits 
- his interrogators. His eyes closed.
MYCROFT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
The only thing that made him open 
up...
In the FLASHBACK MYCROFT enters the cell. JIM’S eyes flick 
open like a reptile. Stares.
Back to the Diogenes -
MYCROFT (CONT’D)
I could get him to talk, just a 
little, but -
JOHN
(Disgusted)
In return you had to offer him 
Sherlock’s life story.
Silence.
JOHN (CONT’D)
One big lie, - Sherlock’s a 
fraud. People will swallow it 
because it’s wrapped up in all 
these truths. Moriarty wanted 
Sherlock destroyed and you’ve 
given him the perfect ammunition.
He makes to go.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

JOHN comes back to Bart’s to find SHERLOCK sitting in the 
dark. A squash ball in his hand - bouncing it around.
JOHN
Got your message
SHERLOCK
That computer code is the key to 
this. We find it we can use it. 
Beat Moriarty at his own game.
JOHN
What do you mean ‘use it’?
SHERLOCK
He’s created a false identity...
JOHN
(Realises, excited)
You mean go into those records 
and destroy Brook? Bring Jim 
Moriarty back again?
SHERLOCK
Somewhere in 221B - somewhere, on 
the day of the verdict - he left 
it hidden...
FLASHBACK -
JUMP CUT through a sequence of memories -
JIM arriving in the flat -
JIM sitting in the chair -
JIM eating the apple -
JOHN
What did he touch?
SHERLOCK
An apple. Nothing else.

JOHN
Did he write anything down?
SHERLOCK
No. 
Sherlock’s screws his eyes shut. Thinks, thinks, thinks. 
He starts drumming his fingers on the arm of the chair. 
Suddenly his eyes flash open. He looks furtively over at 
John and takes out his phone. 
Finds the text from Jim from months ago. Chooses ‘Reply’.
‘Come and play. Bart’s Hospital. Rooftop. SH. PS. Got 
something of yours you might want back.’
Send.

SHERLOCK playing with the squash ball. JOHN’s phone buzzes. 
JOHN
Hello? 
(Listens)
Yes. I’m John Watson. Yes?
(Sherlock glances over)
What? 
John’s face falls. It’s seriously bad news.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Is she ok? What happened? 
(listens)
Oh God. I’m coming. Ok. I’m 
coming now.
He hangs up.
SHERLOCK
What is it?
JOHN
Paramedics. Mrs Hudson. She’s 
been shot. 
SHERLOCK
What? How?
JOHN
(Angry)
I don’t know!

One of those bloody killers 
you’ve managed to attract! Jesus.
She’s dying, Sherlock. Come on.
He dashes to the door.
SHERLOCK
You go. I’m busy.
JOHN
Busy? 
SHERLOCK
Thinking. I need to think. 
JOHN
(Appalled)
You’ve got to - Doesn’t she mean 
anything to you?
SHERLOCK
She’s my landlady. 
JOHN
She’s dying, you 
bloody...machine!
He despairs.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Oh sod this. You stay here if you 
want to. On your own. 
SHERLOCK
Alone is what I have. Alone 
protects me.
JOHN
Friends protect people. 
Sherlock shrugs.
JOHN looks at him with utter disgust, then grabs his coat 
and rushes out.
SHERLOCK’S mobile beeps. Message says: ‘Waiting’.
SHERLOCK watches as the door swings shut after John, then 
calmly heads for the exit.

JOHN (CONT'D)


JIM waiting for him - sitting precariously on the edge of the 
building. The music is coming from his phone, sitting in a 
speaker.
JIM
Lovely morning. Well, here we at 
last. You and me, Sherlock. And our 
problem. The final problem. Did you 
guess it?
The song hits the chorus.
JIM (CONT’D)
Staying alive. It’s just so boring. 
Isn’t it? It’s just ... staying. 
I’ve been searching all my life for 
distractions. You were the best - 
and now I don’t even have you. 
Because I’ve beaten you - and you 
know what, in the end it was easy. 
So easy. And now it’s back to 
playing with the ordinary people 
again - and it turns out you’re one 
of them after all. Boo.
For a moment he’s just staring, haunted - like he’s really 
lost something. Then he pulls himself together - to business! 
JIM (CONT’D)
Oh well! 
(teasingly)
Come on. Admit it. Did you almost 
start to wonder if I was real? Did 
I nearly get you? Did I? 
SHERLOCK
Richard Brook.
JIM
No one seems to get the joke. But 
you do.
SHERLOCK
Of course.
JIM
Attaboy.
SHERLOCK
Rich Brook. In German it’s 
‘Reichenbach’.

SHERLOCK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
The case that made my name.
Back to Bart’s -
JIM
Just trying to have some fun. Not 
cross, are you? 
SHERLOCK shrugs: doesn’t mind. 
He taps his fingers on the wall. A distinctive rhythm.
JIM (CONT’D)
Oh, good. You got that too. 
FLASHBACK to JIM drumming his fingers.
Da - dada - da - da- dadadah - da - dada - da!
SHERLOCK
The beats. Like digits. 
FLASHBACK - JIM still drumming.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Every beat is a one - every rest a 
zero. Binary code. That’s why all 
those assassins tried to save my 
life - it was hidden on me. Hidden 
inside my head. A few lines of 
computer code that can break inside 
any system!
JIM
(Grins)
Told all my clients - last one to 
get to Sherlock is a sissy. 
SHERLOCK
Yes. But now I’ve got the code here 
-
(taps his head)
- I can alter all the records you
created - kill Rich Brook and bring
back Jim Moriarty.
JIM starts to laugh.
JIM
Oh my. You’re so easy to tease. 
There is no key, doofus. Those 
digits are utterly meaningless.
SHERLOCK looks crestfallen.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

JIM (CONT’D)
You really think a couple of lines 
of code are going to crash the 
whole world around our ears? I’m 
disappointed in you, ordinary
Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
But the rhythm...
JIM
Partita no.1. I earned a billion 
thanks to Johann Sebastian Bach.
SHERLOCK
Then -- 
JIM
How did I break in? To the bank, 
the Tower, the prison? Daylight 
robbery. Just takes some willing 
participants.
FLASHBACK.
The Tower of London. Security Room. Two SECURITY GUARDS 
watching, a SECURITY GUARD says something like, “ fancy a 
cuupa?”
The colleague goes out.
The one left alone starts to press the buttons to shut all 
the doors and turn off the lasers.
Clang! Clang! Clang!
Back to rooftop -
JIM (CONT’D)
I knew you’d fall for it. Your 
weakness - you always want 
everything to be clever. Now. Shall 
we finish the game? One final act. 
Glad you chose a tall building. 
Groovy way to do it.
SHERLOCK
Do what?
Silence. SHERLOCK stares. 
And then he ‘realises’ with horror.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Ah yes. Of course. My suicide.

JIM
Well... I just wanted us to be 
alone. No gooseberries.
(smiles)
You did it to yourself, you know? 
All I did was pull one tiny little 
thread. All that resentment, you 
created that - I just had to pull 
it down on top of you.
SHERLOCK
You haven’t won yet. 
JIM
No?
SHERLOCK
No. I can prove still my innocence. 
Prove you made up a whole false 
identity...
JIM
Killing yourself would really be a 
lot less effort.
Beat.
JIM (CONT’D)
Oh go on. For me. Pleeease.
SHERLOCK
You’re insane.
JIM
Are you just getting that? Let me

tea for the WORKMAN doing the tiling. Camera lingers on him - 
his grave expression. Something hard and cruel in his facial 
expression when her back is turned.
CUT to LESTRADE’S new JUNIOR OFFICER bringing LESTRADE some 
paperwork. His cold expression.
CUT to a THIRD ASSASIN - in an undisclosed location, taking a 
rifle out of it’s case.
JIM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
They’ve been given their orders to 
kill. You can have me arrested - do 
what you like - nothing will

trigger. Your only three friends in

JIM
Oh, come on Sherlock - you’ve even 
got an audience now. Off you pop. 
Strawberry jam time.
Sherlock - now looking down, like he’s really contemplating 
the fall, actually doing it.
JIM (CONT’D)
Go on. I've told you how this ends. 
No alternatives, baby. The only 
thing that will call off the 
killers is your death - I'm 
certainly not going to do it.
SHERLOCK
I take it I'm allowed a moment of 
privacy.
JIM
Of course.
Sherlock - has taken a step closer to the edge. Jim starts to 
walk away, but -
- suddenly Sherlock laughs.
This impacts on Jim. What? What??
Sherlock turns. Confident. He's realised something.
JIM (CONT’D)
(Slightly unnerved)
What? What is it? 
Sherlock smiles. 
JIM (CONT’D)
What is it? What have I missed?
SHERLOCK
You’re not going to do it? The 
killers can be called off, then?
On Jim - oops!

a number?

Jim doesn’t respond. 
Sherlock steps towards him. Framed against the sky. And his 
smile drops. He looks almost demonic now.
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I don’t have to die - if I’ve got 
you.
JIM
What - you think you’re going to 
make me abort the order? You think 
you can make me do that?
Sherlock - stepping closer now. So calm, so scary.
SHERLOCK
Yes. And so do you.
Jim faltering back a step. 
JIM
Oh, come on. Even your brother and 
all the King’s horses couldn’t make 
me do a thing I didn’t want to.
SHERLOCK
I’m not my brother. Remember - 
Beat. 
SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
I’m you. Prepared to do anything - 
prepared to burn. Prepared to do 
what ordinary people won’t do. You 
want me to go the distance. To 
shake hands in hell, Jim. I’m not 
going to disappoint you.
A step closer. But Jim - still smiling, still confident.
JIM
Nah. You talk big, but nah. You’re 
ordinary - you’re on the side of 
the angels.
SHERLOCK
On the side of the angels - yes, 
maybe. But Jim - don’t ever think 
I’m one of them.
On Jim - oh! As he starts to believe him, and he melts into a 
smile.
JIM
Oh, you’re right. You are, you’re 
me.

you’ve got a way out.
(A beat, a grin)
Well! Good luck with that!

OK. Look up. I’m on the rooftop

I invented Moriarty.

Why are you saying this?

Don’t. Please.

SHERLOCK
The newspapers were right. Tell 
Lestrade. And Mrs. Hudson. And 
Molly. In fact tell everyone who 
will listen. I created Moriarty
for my own purposes. 
Beat. JOHN just doesn’t know how to reply -
JOHN
When we met - the first time we 
met. You knew all about my sister 
-
SHERLOCK
No-one could be that clever.
JOHN
You could.
SHERLOCK
I researched you. Before we met. 
I discovered what I could to 
impress you. It’s a trick, John. 
Just a magic trick.
JOHN
(Bellowing)
Stop it! 
JOHN instinctively takes a step onto the road  -
SHERLOCK
Don’t. Don’t move. Stay right 
where you are. Keep your eyes 
fixed on me. I need you to do 
this for me.
JOHN
Do what?
SHERLOCK
This phone call. It’s my note, in 
a way. You have to write a note. 
JOHN
Write a note when?

JOHN rushes across the street - and a CYCLIST knocks into 
him. John is hurled onto the tarmac. The cyclist doesn’t 
stop. 
John’s POV as he gets up. It’s like he’s underwater. Sound, 
images, all distorted. People try to help him but he pushes 
them away. It’s like slo-mo. Cars and more cyclists and 
pedestrians get in his way as he runs across the road. 
Seems to take him an age to reach the bruised and broken 
body of his friend.
Finds SHERLOCK on the pavement, battered and bleeding, 
surrounded by DOCTORS. One of the DOCTORS taking a pulse in 
SHERLOCK’S neck. Shakes his head. John falls to his knees 
and presses his fingers to Sherlock’s wrist. 
No pulse. Nothing at all. Utter despair and desolation. His 
best friend is dead.
He tries to cradle SHERLOCK’S dead body in his arms. But a 
gurney arrives and the DOCTORS whisk the body inside. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
Please...please, he’s...he’s...
The gurney is whisked into the hospital. 
John’s POV. A young DOCTOR is talking to him but John 
doesn’t seem to be able to hear.
POV across the street - an assassin watching JOHN through the  
cross-hairs of a rifle. Lowers the gun - 
INT. 221B BAKER STREET. DAY

JOHN is in the flat, alone. Silence. Stares around at the 
familiar room. Does not know how to react. Does not know 
how to be.
INT. DIOGENES CLUB. DAY
109
109
MYCROFT reads the paper: ‘SUICIDE OF FAKE GENIUS’.
He puts down the paper and stares into space.
INT. ROOM. DAY

JOHN and ELLA, his therapist. Days later.
ELLA
There’s stuff you wanted to say, 
but didn’t say.
JOHN
Yes.

ELLA
OK. Say it now, John. Say it to 
me.
JOHN
No. Sorry. Can’t.
JOHN cries.
INT. CAR. DAY
111
111
JOHN in the back of a car, travelling through London. MRS. 
HUDSON beside him. A bouquet of flowers in her hands.
EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
112
112
An urban cemetery. Thick carpet of gravestones in the 
foreground - the spires of the city behind.
A plain black marble headstone has just been set.
MRS. HUDSON and JOHN come to see it. She takes JOHN’S arm. 
They stand there silently.
Birds tweet. Spring is coming. A few buds on the trees.
MRS. HUDSON
There’s all the stuff. All the 
science equipment. I left it all 
in boxes. I don’t know what needs 
doing. Thought I might take it to 
a school.
(Beat)
Would you...?
JOHN
I can’t go back to the flat
again. Not at the moment.
Camera turns round. Headstone: ‘SHERLOCK HOLMES’. (Dates 
obscured).
JOHN (CONT’D)
I’m... angry. 
MRS. HUDSON
It’s OK, John. Nothing unusual in 
that. ‘S the way he made everyone 
feel. All those marks on my 
table. And the noise. Firing guns 
at half past one in the morning.
JOHN
Yes.
Reichenbach Script 29/06/2011

MRS. HUDSON
Bloody specimens in my fridge. 
Imagine - keeping bodies where 
there’s food.
JOHN
(Irritated by this 
tirade)
Yep.
MRS. HUDSON
And the fighting. Drove me up the 
wall with all his carrying on.
JOHN
Yep. OK. I’m not actually that 
angry.
Beat.
MRS. HUDSON
I’ll leave you alone to - you 
know.
And she scuttles away. Long silence. And then -
JOHN
You told me once that you weren’t 
a hero. And there were days I 
didn’t even think you were human. 
But you know what? You were the 
best man, and the most human 
human being I have ever known. 
And nothing will ever make me 
believe that you lied to me.
He pulls that scarf out of his pocket and wraps it around the 
tombstone.
JOHN (CONT’D)
I was so lost, and I owe you so 
much - but sorry, mate, there’s 
just one more thing. One more 
miracle, Sherlock. Don’t be dead. 
Please. For me - just stop it. Just 
stop being dead.
Crying now. And he turns, and starts walking away. We hold on 
him, a lonely figure, heading away. 
Take our time with this, watch him climb in the cab with 
MRS. HUDSON and drive away.
And at the last possible moment the camera whips round. 
There is SHERLOCK, watching everything. Watching JOHN 
leaving.
