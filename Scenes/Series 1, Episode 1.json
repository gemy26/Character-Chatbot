A very bad\ncabbie.  You should\u2019ve seen the\nroute we took here.\nA STUDY IN PINK  SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED  18/04/10\n108A.\n\n\nAnd now they\u2019re both giggling.  Like schoolboys.\nJOHN\nStop it, we can\u2019t giggle.  It\u2019s a\nbloody crime scene, stop.\nSHERLOCK\nDon\u2019t blame me.  You shot him!\nJOHN\nYou could maybe keep your voice\ndown a bit.\nAnd they\u2019re giggling again.  John notices Sally Donovan a\nlittle distance away (too far to overhear) staring at them.\nJOHN\nSorry.  Sorry, just ... nerves.\nSHERLOCK\nSorry.\nShe moves on.  John looks to Sherlock, more serious now.\nJOHN\nYou were going to take the damn\npill, weren\u2019t you?\nSHERLOCK\nCourse I wasn\u2019t.  Playing for time.\nKnew you\u2019d show up.\nJOHN\nNo, you didn\u2019t.  That\u2019s how you get\nyour kicks, isn\u2019t it?   Risking\nyour life to prove you\u2019re clever.\nSHERLOCK\nWhy would I do that?\nJOHN\nBecause you\u2019re an idiot.\nSherlock looks at him for a moment, affronted.  And then ...\nsmiles.  And if it begins anywhere, it begins here - the two\nbest friends ever.\nA STUDY IN PINK  SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED  18/04/10\n109.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nDinner?\nJOHN\nStarving.\nSherlock starts leading the way.\nSHERLOCK\nThere\u2019s a good Chinese, end of\nBaker Street - stays open \u2018til two.\nYou can always tell a good Chinese\nby examining the bottom third of\nthe doorhandle --\nBut John isn\u2019t listening - he\u2019s seen something ahead.\n*\nA STUDY IN PINK  SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED  18/04/10\n110.\n\n\nJohn\u2019s POV.  Parked outside the college gates.  A black limo.  *\nStanding outside it, staring at them both - M.  Standing a\nrespectful distance behind, tapping away on her Blackberry,\nis the beautiful woman.\nJOHN\nSherlock, that\u2019s him.  That\u2019s the\nguy I was talking about...\nSHERLOCK\nI know exactly who that is.\nHe starts towards M.\nM starts towards him.\nThey meet in the gateway.  Like gunfighters.\nM\nSo!  Another case cracked.  How\nvery public spirited of you.\nThough that\u2019s never really ever\nyour motivation, is it?\nSHERLOCK\nWhat are you doing here?\nM\nAs ever ... I am concerned about\nyou.\nSHERLOCK\nYes.  I\u2019ve been hearing about your\nconcern.\nA STUDY IN PINK  SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED  18/04/10\n111.\n\n\nM\nAlways so aggressive.  Does it\nnever occur to you that you and I\nbelong on the same side.\nSHERLOCK\nOddly enough, no.\nM\nWe have more in common than you\nlike to believe.  This petty feud\nbetween us - it\u2019s simply childish.\nPeople will suffer.  And you know\nhow it always upset Mummy.\nOn John.  What?  What??\nSHERLOCK\nI upset her?  Me?  It wasn\u2019t me who\nupset her, Mycroft -\nJOHN\nNo, sorry, wait, wait - Mummy?\nWho\u2019s Mummy?\nSHERLOCK\nMother.  Our Mother.

I occupy a\nminor post in the British\nGovernment.\nA STUDY IN PINK  SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED  18/04/10\n112.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nHe is the British Government.  When\nhe\u2019s not too busy being the British\nSecret Service.  And the CIA on a\nfreelance basis.  Good evening,\nMycroft - try not to start a war\nbefore I get home, you know what it\ndoes to the traffic.\nSherlock turns on his heel, starts stalking away.\nJOHN\nSo when you say you\u2019re concerned\nabout him, you actually are\nconcerned about him.\nM\nOf course, yes.\nJOHN\nIt actually is a childish feud.\nM\nOh, he\u2019s always been so resentful.\nYou can imagine the Christmas\ndinners.\nJOHN\nYes.  No.  God, no!   Anyway, I\u2019d\nbetter, um ...\n(Glances to the beautiful\nwoman)\nHello again.\nShe looks up from her Blackberry.\nWOMAN\n(Blankly)\nOh, hello.\nJOHN\nWe met, earlier this evening.\nWOMAN\nOh!\nShe returns to her Blackberry.\nJOHN\nOkay.\n(To M)\nGood night.\nM\nGoodnight, Dr. Watson.\nAnd John heads away, running to catch up with Sherlock.
