It\nis a weakness with me, but to be\nfair to myself, it is my only\nweakness. You can\u2019t be allowed to\ncontinue. You just can\u2019t. I would\ntry to convince you, but everything\nI have to say has already to say\nhas already crossed your mind.\nSherlock and John - a glance. A nod from John.

The last\nthing I need is a public image.\nAs he says this, he jams a hat on this heat - and fatefully,\nit happens to be a deerstalker. He pulls it down over his\nface, and starts pushing through the doors -\n- into an explosion of flashbulbs. And the first flash\nbecomes -\n- a newspaper photograph!\nA Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages  - 25/07/2011\n10.\n\n\nA black a white of deerstalker-ed Sherlock and John heading\nout the doors. Pulling out to the headline (NOT front page)\nHAT-MAN AND ROBIN, THE WEB DETECTIVES.\nNow a series of flashes and we see variants of the same image\nfrom various angles in various pages, always centred on the\ndeerstalker. Various headlines. SHERLOCK HOLMES - NET\nPHENOMENON. SHERLOCK - NET \u2018TEC. SHERLOCK AND JOHN - BLOGGER\nDETECTIVES.\nOn the final flash the last one becomes -\nINT. IRENE\u2019S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n12\n12\n- an actual newspaper lying on a table. We hold on a moment -\n- then a hand reaches into shot, a red fingernail traces\nSherlock\u2019s cheekbone for a moment.  During this, from off, we\nhear the beeps of someone punching a number into a phone. The\nphone is now being answered and the hand withdraws.\nIRENE ADLER\n(From off)\nHello. I think it\u2019s time - don\u2019t\nyou?\nAnd then something is tossed casually on to the paper - a\nriding crop, lying right across Sherlock\u2019s face ...\nWe fade to black ...\n"

Not sure\nhow that could be true, but give me\na moment, I\u2019ve only been on the\ncase for eight seconds.\nThey just look at him, startled.\nSHERLOCK\nOh, come on, it\u2019s not code, these\nare seat allocations on a passenger\njet. Look! There are no letters\npast J - the width of the plane is\nthe limit. The numbers only appear\nsingly and never in sequence, but\nthe letters have little runs of\nsequence all over place - families\nand couples sitting together. Only\na Jumbo is wide enough to need a\nletter J, or rows past 55, which\nalways require an upstairs section.\nThere\u2019s a row 13, so we can\neliminate the more superstitious\nairlines.

SPEEDY\u2019S CAFE - DAY\n147\n147\nMYCROFT and JOHN, sitting across the table from each other,\nwith coffees. Silence for a moment - just the hiss of the\nrain outside, the under-sea gloom of the cafe, the soaking\nwet coats of the customers.\nJohn\u2019s eyes go to:\nThe zip-lock file on the table. Through the transparent cover\nhe can see a sheaf of papers, and the leopard skin camera-\nphone.\nJOHN\nThe file on Irene Adler.\nMYCROFT\nClosed for ever. I\u2019m about to go\nand inform my brother - or, if you\nprefer, you are - that she somehow\ngot herself into a witness\nprotection scheme in America. New\nname, new identity. She will\nsurvive and thrive - but he will\nnever see her again.\nJOHN\nWhy would he care?\nMycroft just looks at him. Oh, come now.\nJOHN\nHe despised her at the end. He\nwon\u2019t even mention her by name -\njust \u201cthe woman.\u201d\nMYCROFT\nIs that loathing, or a salute? One\nof a kind, the one woman who\nmatters?\nJOHN\nHe\u2019s not like that. He doesn\u2019t feel\nthings that way. I don\u2019t think ...\nMYCROFT\nMy brother has the brain of\nscientist, or a philosopher. Yet he\nelects to be a detective. What\nmight we deduce about his heart?\nA Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages  - 25/07/2011\n105.\n\n\nJOHN\nI don\u2019t know.\nMYCROFT\nNeither do I. But initially he\nwanted to be a pirate.\nJOHN\nHe\u2019ll be okay with this. Witness\nprotection, never seeing her again,\nhe\u2019ll be fine.\nMYCROFT\nI agree. That\u2019s why I decided to\ntell him that.\nJohn looks at Mycroft. Something new in the room now. What\ndoes he mean?\nJOHN\n... instead of what?\nMYCROFT\nShe\u2019s dead. She was captured by a\nterrorist cell in Islamabad two\nmonths ago, and beheaded.\nA silence between them. Oh.\nJOHN\nDefinitely her? She\u2019s done this\nbefore...\nMYCROFT\nI was thorough this time. It would\ntake Sherlock Holmes to fool me,\nand I don\u2019t think he was on hand,\ndo you?\nAnother silence. Oh God.\nMYCROFT\nSo.\n(Pushes the file over to\nJohn)\nWhat shall we tell Sherlock?\nINT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY\n148\n148\nSHERLOCK at the kitchen table. He\u2019s at his microscope\nstudying something.\nOn John. He\u2019s hesitating a few feet away. He has the file in\nhis hand.\nThe rain is streaming down the windows, casting shadow-\npatterns all over the walls. The little flat has never looked\nso gloomy.\nA Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages  - 25/07/2011\n106.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\n(Without looking up)\nClearly you have news. If it\u2019s\nabout that triple murder in Leeds,\nit was the gardener. Did nobody\nnotice his earring?\nJOHN\nHi. No, it\u2019s ... it\u2019s about Irene\nAdler.\nAnd Sherlock looks up, instantly interested.\nOn John, registering this.\nSHERLOCK\nWell? Has something happened? Has\nshe turned up again?\nJOHN\nNo. No, she\u2019s ... I just bumped\ninto Mycroft downstairs, he had to\ntake a call ...\nSHERLOCK\nIs she back in London?\nAnd he\u2019s on his feet. He\u2019s come over to John. He\u2019s just that\nlittle bit too interested.\nJOHN\nNo. She\u2019s ...\nAnd he\u2019s looking hard at Sherlock. And Sherlock is looking a\nbit too hard at him. And John makes the fateful decision.\nJOHN\nShe\u2019s in America.\nSHERLOCK\nAmerica?\nJOHN\nYeah. She\u2019s gone into a witness\nprotection scheme, apparently.\nDon\u2019t know how she swung it. But,\nyou know ...\nSHERLOCK\nI know what?\nJOHN\nWell. You won\u2019t able to see her\nagain.\nSHERLOCK\nWhy would I want to see her again?\nJOHN\nDidn\u2019t say you did.\nA Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages  - 25/07/2011\n107.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nIs that her file?\nJOHN\nYeah - got to take it back to\nMycroft. Do you ... want a look at\nit?\nSHERLOCK\nNo.\nSherlock has gone back to his microscope.\nOh John: has he misjudged. Should he have told him,\nJOHN\nListen. Actually -\nSHERLOCK\n(Without looking up)\nOh, but I\u2019ll have the camera-phone.\nHe puts his hand out for it.\nJOHN\nThere\u2019s nothing on it any more. It\nwas all stripped off.\nSHERLOCK\nI know. But I\u2019ll have it.\nJOHN\nNo, it has to go back to Mycroft.\nYou can\u2019t keep this.\nSherlock doesn\u2019t reply, or even look at him. Just continues\nto hold his hand out.\nJOHN\nSherlock, I have to take this back.\nIt\u2019s government property now, it\u2019s -\nSHERLOCK\nPlease.\nStill hasn\u2019t looked round, still hasn\u2019t registered any\nemotion.\nJohn: what the hell does he do. He steps over, hands him the\ncamera-phone. Sherlock pockets it.\nSHERLOCK\nThank you.\nJohn, now hesitating to the door.\nJOHN\nBetter take this back down.\nA Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages  - 25/07/2011\n108.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nYes.\nJohn, at the door, turns.\nJOHN\nDid she ever text you again? After\n... all that?\nSHERLOCK\nOnce. A couple of months ago.\nJOHN\nWhat did she say?\nSHERLOCK\nGoodbye, Mr. Holmes.\nOn John. Considers that for a moment - probably the last day\nof her life. He heads out.\nWe stay on Sherlock. Sits back from the microscope. Then\nstands, crossing to the window. He\u2019s got his phone out, is\nscrolling through some old texts.\nCloser on the phone. Under the heading The Woman, all her\ntexts. The last one\nGOOD-BYE MR. HOLMES.\nOn this we dissolve to:\nINT. GROTTY LITTLE ROOM/ISLAMABAD - DAY\n149\n149\nIRENE, on her last day, kneeling in the centre of a room,\nsurrounded by MASKED AND ROBED TERRORISTS.\nIrene is calm, serene - and sending one last text. She now\nhands her phone to one of the terrorists, and we see her say\n\u201cThankyou\u201d. Her EXECUTIONER is stepping up behind her now,\nswinging back with his long sword.\nCloser on Irene now, as she straightens her neck and prepares\nherself for the end. So sad, so full of regrets. She slowly\ncloses her eyes.\nAnd as her eyes close, the screen fades into darkness.\nWe hold the darkness for a long final moment, like the movie\nreally is over. Then:\nAn ORGASMIC GASP. A text has arrived!\nOn Irene as her eyes fly open again. What? Where did that\ncome from??\nThe terrorists all looking at each other now. What??\nA Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages  - 25/07/2011\n109.\n\n\nBut Irene is looking up at her tall, thin executioner. The\nface is covered but the voice is familiar.\nSHERLOCK\nWhen I say run, run!\nOn Irene - her face breaks into a delighted, incredulous\ngrin.\nINT. 221B BAKER STREET - DAY\n150\n150\nAnd now the same grin on Sherlock\u2019s face, remembering that\nday. He laughs! Fooled them all again! He pulls the leopard\nskin camera-phone from his pocket, tosses it in his hand.\nSHERLOCK\n(As a sort of salute)\nThe Woman!\nHe takes the camera-phone, opens his desk drawer, drops it\ninside. Looks at it lying there for moment.\nSHERLOCK\n(More fondly)\nThe Woman.\nOn his face, clear moment of warmth - remembering the long\ncontest, that remarkable woman, the year of Irene Adler.\nThen he closes the drawer. It\u2019s almost ceremonial - like he\u2019s\nputting something away. Then the warmth just drops from his\nface, and he\u2019s Sherlock Holmes again.\nWe hold the closed drawer big in the foreground as he turns\nand walks away - back to his microscope, back to work...\nEND CREDITS\nA Scandal in Belgravia - Pink Pages  - 25/07/2011\n110."
