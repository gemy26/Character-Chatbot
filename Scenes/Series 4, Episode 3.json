As though a child were scampering\nacross the floor.\nMycroft peers into the darkness.\nNo-one there.\nThen, a soft, sibilant, teasing baby-ish girl\u2019s voice ...\nGIRL\u2019S VOICE\nMycroft...\nMycroft takes out his phone.\nDials a three digit number.\nGIRL\u2019S VOICE (CONT\u2019D)\nMycroft...\nThe phone rings.

We\ncan\u2019t yet make out her face.\nMycroft moves closer.\nCloser...\nCloser...\nHe brings the phone torch to bear on the girl\u2019s face but -\n- she has no face!!\nIt\u2019s a life-like mannequin.\nThe sound of scampering feet -\n- Mycroft whirls round. A tiny figure dashes off round the\ncorner.\nGIRL\u2019S VOICE\nMycroft...\nMycroft pursues...\nCUT TO:\nINT. MYCROFT\u2019S HOUSE.

The suit of armour?\nNo.\nFrom behind the armour has stepped - a CLOWN!\nA horrible, grinning freakish clown in candy stripe costume.\nIt grabs the sword from the suit of armour and raises it!\nMYCROFT\nYou can\u2019t have got out. You can\u2019t.\nMycroft raises his umbrella sword -\n- then, unexpectedly, he whips out his handkerchief, wraps it\nround his hand and grabs the blade of his sword. It folds\nneatly back on itself producing -\n- a gun barrel!\nAnother twist of the handle, and a trigger appears.\nMycroft calmly aims the weapon and fires.\nBang!\nBang!\nBang!\nThe Clown stops in its tracks.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n9.\n\n\nThen there\u2019s a clatter from close by.\nMycroft looks down.\nHalf a dozen bullets spill from the darkness across the\nfloor.\nGIRL\u2019S VOICE\nNo use, Mycroft. There\u2019s no\ndefence.

MYCROFT\u2019S HOUSE. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT\n7\n7\nA sweeping staircase, a mighty front door. Moonlight streams\nthrough the grand window on the stairs, projecting a huge\noblong of segmented moonlight over the entire hallway (as\nnoir and surreal as we dare.)\nMycroft scrabbling, at the door, unable to open it for a\nmoment -\n- then a shadow is moving through the projected moonlight.\nMycroft looks up at staircase window, gapes.\nPulling back to an iconic shot - Mycroft cowering in the\nshadow now spread across the floor and wall: the most famous\nprofile in the world, Sherlock Holmes in his deerstalker.\nHolding on this for a moment. Then the shadow moves, as\nSherlock opens the window and steps through.\nMYCROFT\n... Sherlock?\nOn Sherlock: just an eerie silhouette against the moonlight.\nSHERLOCK\nBrother mine.\nMYCROFT\n... help me..\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n11.\n\n\nA beat -\n- then Sherlock puts his fingers to his mouth and blows the\nmost almighty whistle\nThe lights come up.\nStepping from the shadows, the various players in the drama.\nThe clown. The little girl, pulling off her mask to reveal a\ndwarf.\nAll suddenly very ordinary, and very real.\nSHERLOCK\nExperiment complete. Conclusion: I\nhave a sister.\nMYCROFT\n... this was you? All of this, you?\nSHERLOCK\nConclusion two: my sister - Eurus,\napparently - has been incarcerated\nfrom an early age in a secure\ninstitution under my brother\u2019s\ncontrol. Hey bro!\nMYCROFT\nWhy would you do this? This\npantomime, why?\nSHERLOCK\nConclusion three: you are terrified\nof her.\nMYCROFT\nYou have no idea what you\u2019re\ndealing with. None at all.\nA voice from behind Mycroft.\nJOHN\nNew information.\nMycroft whirls. The front door is open now, John is leaning\nin the doorway.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nShe\u2019s out.\nMYCROFT\n... that\u2019s not possible.\nSHERLOCK\n(Coming down the stairs)\nIt\u2019s more than possible, she was\nJohn\u2019s therapist.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n12.\n\n\nJOHN\nShot me in the face during a\nsession.\nSHERLOCK\nOnly with a tranquiliser.\nJOHN\nYeah, and I still had ten minutes\nto go.\nSHERLOCK\n(to the players)\nRight, you lot, Wiggins is at the\ngate, he\u2019s got your money.

Sleep well!\nHe sweeps out. Now just John and a severely shaken Mycroft.\nMYCROFT\nDr. Watson, why did he do that to\nme. That was insane.\nJOHN\nYeah, well someone convinced him\nyou\u2019d never tell the truth unless\nyou were actually wetting yourself.\nMYCROFT\nSomeone?\nJOHN\nProbably me.\nJohn turns to the door.\nMYCROFT\nThat\u2019s it, you\u2019re just going to go?\nJOHN\nOh, don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a place\nfor people like you - the\ndesperate, the terrified, the ones\nwith nowhere else to run ...\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n13.\n\n\nMYCROFT\nWhat place?\nJOHN\n221B Baker Street.

Fingers\ndrumming, waiting.\nThe client chair, empty. Mycroft, stands a few feet behind.\nOut of place, unsure, indignant.\nMrs Hudson, standing in the doorway, arms folded, thoroughly\nenjoying his discomfiture.\nMRS HUDSON\nYou have to sit in the chair. They\nwon\u2019t talk to you unless you sit in\nthe chair, it\u2019s the rules.\nMYCROFT\nFor God\u2019s sake! I\u2019m not a client!\nJohn and Sherlock glance at each other.\nSHERLOCK\nThen get out.\nA moment. A capitulation. Like very movement is a personal\naffront, Mycroft seats himself in the client chair.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n14.\n\n\nMYCROFT\nShe\u2019s not going to stay there, is\nshe?\nSherlock dismisses her with a nod of his head.\nMRS HUDSON\n(As she goes - to Mycroft)\nDo you want a cup of tea?\nMYCROFT\nThankyou.\nMRS HUDSON\nKettle\u2019s over there.\nShe goes. A pained silence.\nMYCROFT\nWhat happens now? Are you going to\nmake deductions?\nSHERLOCK\nI just want the truth, Mycroft.\nPure and simple.\nMYCROFT\nWho was it said \u201cThe truth is\nrarely pure and never simple\u201d?\nSHERLOCK\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care.\n(Fixes Mycroft with a\nlaser  glare)\nThere were three of us. I know that\nnow. You, me and ... Eurus.\nMycroft looks at his brother then at John. A big moment.\nHe nods.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nThe sister I can\u2019t remember.\nMycroft: nods again. Like he doesn\u2019t want to say these words\nout loud.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nInteresting name. Greek, isn\u2019t it?\nJOHN\n(Looking at a note he\u2019s\nmade)\nLiterally, the God of the East\nWind.\nMYCROFT\nYes.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n15.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nThe East Wind.\nMYCROFT\nYes.\nSHERLOCK\n\u201cThe East Wind is coming,\nSherlock!\u201d You used that to scare\nme.\nMYCROFT\nNo.\nSHERLOCK\nYou turned my sister into a ghost\nstory to bully me.\nMYCROFT\nOf course I didn\u2019t. I monitored\nyou.\nJOHN\nYou what?\nMYCROFT\nMemories can resurface. Wounds can\nreopen. The roads we walk have\ndemons beneath - and yours have\nbeen waiting for a very long time.\nI never bullied you. I used, at\ndiscreet intervals, potential\ntrigger words, to update myself on\nyour mental condition. I was\nlooking after you.\nSHERLOCK\nWhy don\u2019t I remember her?\nHe glances at John.\nMYCROFT\nThis is a private matter...\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n16.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nJohn stays.\nMYCROFT\nThis is family.\nSHERLOCK\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s staying.\nBeat. Mycroft simmers but accepts.\nJOHN\nSo. There were three Holmes kids.\nWhat was the age gap?\nMYCROFT\nSeven years between myself and\nSherlock, one year between Sherlock\nand Eurus.\nJOHN\nMiddle child - explains a lot. And\ndid she have it too?\nMYCROFT\nHave what?\nJOHN\nThe deduction thing.\nMYCROFT\n(disdainful)\nThe deduction thing?\nJOHN\nYes.\nMYCROFT\nMore than you can know.\nJOHN\nEnlighten me.\nMYCROFT\nYou realise I\u2019m the smart one -\nSHERLOCK\nAs you never cease to announce.\nMYCROFT\n- but Eurus ... she was ...\nincandescent. Even then. Our\nabilities were professionally\nassessed, more than once. I was\ndescribed as an era-defining\ngenius. Eurus was described as\nbeyond Newton.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n17-18.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nSo. Why don\u2019t I remember her?\nMYCROFT\nYou do remember her. In a way.\nEvery choice you have ever made,\nevery path you have taken - the man\nyou are today is your memory of\nEurus.\nOn Mycroft\u2019s face - sunlight dapples across it, like he\u2019s now\nseeing into the past ...\nCUT TO:\n"

Long division.\nMYCROFT\nShe predicted the exact dates of\nthe last three terrorist attacks on\nthe British mainland, after an hour\non Twitter - that sort of thing. In\nreturn, however, she requires ...\ntreats.

It carries on throughout\nSitting up where is he?\nLooking round. He\u2019s in the white half of the Oval cell\nSherlock, pacing, bruised face. Mycroft standing a little\nbeyond him, clearly terrified.\nSitting on the floor, his back against the wall, is the\nGovernor. His head is lowered and he seems to be sobbing.\nIn the black half of the cell, at television has been set up,\nfacing them. Blank for the moment.\nSherlock, noticing John is recovering.\nSHERLOCK\nHow are you?\nJOHN\n(Feeling at his head)\nBit of a lump.\nSHERLOCK\nTrue, but you have your uses.\nJOHN\nDid you see your sister?\nSHERLOCK\nYes.\nJOHN\nHow was it?\nSHERLOCK\nFamily\u2019s always difficult.\nMYCROFT\nIs this an occasion for banter??\nSHERLOCK\nCase in point.\nJOHN\nAre we phoning someone?\nSHERLOCK\nApparently.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n66.\n\n\nJOHN\n(noticing Governor)\nWhat\u2019s he doing in here?\nSHERLOCK\nAs he\u2019s told.

You go girl!\nJOHN\nHow can that be Moriarty?\nEURUS\nOh he recorded loads of little\nmessages for me, before he died, he\nloved it. Did you know his brother\nwas a station master? I think he\nwas always jealous.\nSHERLOCK\nThe girl - where did she go? Can I\ntalk to her again?\nEURUS\nPoor little thing. Alone in the sky\non a great big plane, with nowhere\nto land.

Oh dear God.\nEURUS\nYou can\u2019t do it, Sherlock. If you\ndo it, it won\u2019t count, I\u2019ll kill\nher anyway. It has to be your\nbrother or your friend.\nA terrible silence\nTHE GOVERNOR\n... please. You have to do this.\nShe means it, she will kill her.\nSherlock slowly looks to Mycroft.\nSHERLOCK\nI don\u2019t think we have a choice.\nHe holds the gun out to him.\nEURUS\nRight then! Countdown starting.\nMYCROFT\n... how long?\nEURUS\nThe countdown is for me.\nWithholding the precise deadline\nwill apply the emotional pressure\nmore evenly.

I will not have\nblood on my hands.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n70.\n\n\nEURUS\nYes, very good, thankyou.\nTHE GOVERNOR\nKilling my wife is what you\u2019re\ndoing??\nMYCROFT\nNo.\nEURUS\nYou see?\nMycroft steps away.

I should have fitted\nyou with a cardiograph.\nThen John: soft-spoken, but such pain.\nJOHN\nI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t.\nSHERLOCK\nI know.\nEURUS\nIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s all\nuseful data.\nWith an anguished scream, the Governor twists round, wrenches\nthe gun from John -\nJOHN\nNo, stop, no!\n- and rams the gun under his own chin.\nNow, on Sherlock, John and Mycroft, watching in horror.\nTHE GOVERNOR\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. Remember me!\nThe last word is cut off by BLAM! We stay on three men,\nappalled -\n- as we hear the body fall like a sack of cement. (NB No\nblood, suicide off-screen.)\nA throbbing silence.\nMycroft, now over at the wall, vomiting.\nSherlock looks coldly at him, then to his friend.\nJohn, shaken to the core. He was weak, and knows it.\nSHERLOCK\nYou okay?\nJohn, still staring at the dead man. Gives a tiny shake of\nhis head. He\u2019s nowhere close to okay.\nSherlock turns to the television, and Eurus.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nRight, there you go, got what you\nwanted. He\u2019s dead.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n73.\n\n\nEURUS\nDead or alive, he really wasn\u2019t\nvery interesting. But you three\nwere wonderful, thankyou. You see\nwhat you did, Dr. Watson?\nSpecifically because of your moral\ncode - because you don\u2019t want blood\non your hands - two people are\ndead, instead of one.\nJOHN\n... two people?\nEURUS\nYes, sorry, hang on.\n(She glances off)\nWould you mind?\nAnd blam! from the television.\nEurus reaches up and moves the camera so that we now have a\nview of the Governor\u2019s wife hanging limp in her chair. (NB -\nagain, we don\u2019t see the shooting.)\nEURUS (CONT\u2019D)\nWhat advantage did your moral code\ngrant you? Is it not, in the end,\nselfish to keep one\u2019s hands clean,\nat the expense of another\u2019s life?\nJOHN\nYou didn\u2019t have to kill her.\nEURUS\nThe condition of her survival was\nthat you or Mycroft had to kill her\nhusband. This an experiment, there\nwill be rigour.\nJohn, just staring at her - no words.\nEURUS (CONT\u2019D)\nSherlock, pick up the gun. It\u2019s\nyour turn next. When I tell you to\nuse it - and I will - remember what\nhappened this time.\nSherlock eyes the gun on the floor - it\u2019s partly blood\nspattered. He makes no move to pick it.\nSHERLOCK\nWhat if I don\u2019t want a gun.\nEURUS\nThe gun is intended as a mercy.\nSHERLOCK\nFor who?\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n74.\n\n\nEURUS\nYou.\nSHERLOCK\nHow so?\nEURUS\nIf someone else had to die, would\nyou really want to do it with your\nbare hands? It would waste valuable\ntime.\nA moment, as that moment lands, for the three of them.\nMycroft, terrified. John, stoic. Sherlock, still unsure.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 3 - BLUE AMENDS - 27.07.16\n74A.\n\n\nJOHN\nProbably just take it.\nSherlock, stiff little nod. Steps forward, picks up the gun.\nSHERLOCK\nThere\u2019s only one bullet left.\nEURUS\nYou will only need one. But you\nwill need it.\nSherlock looks to Mycroft, looks to John - no choice. He\nshoves the gun into his belt.\nA door is sliding open at the back of cell.\nEURUS (CONT\u2019D)\nPlease go through. There\u2019s a few\ntasks for you, and a girl on a\nplane who\u2019s getting very, very\nscared.\nJohn and Mycroft move towards it - but Sherlock hangs back a\nbeat.\nSHERLOCK\nTreats?\nMYCROFT\nJust, you know ... a violin.\nSHERLOCK\nIn exchange for?\nMYCROFT\n... she\u2019s very clever.\nSherlock, looking so coldly at him.\nSHERLOCK\nI\u2019m beginning to think you\u2019re not.\nAvoiding his brother\u2019s gaze, Mycroft heads on.\nSherlock, giving him the deadliest route, now following.\nSherlock, John and Mycroft, walking through to -\nTANNOY MORIARTY\nCome on, now, all aboard.

It\u2019s no more than having a\nfavourite colour. Why choose? It\u2019s\nlike smell. A human\u2019s sense of\nsmell is limited - only registers\ngood and bad. Attractive or\nrepulsive. But a dog\u2019s sense of\nsmell can read the whole world like\na book, and so doesn\u2019t need the\ncrudity of value judgments. Good\nand bad are simplifications for\nsmaller minds.
