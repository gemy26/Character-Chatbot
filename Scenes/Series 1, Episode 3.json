He learned us how\nto cut up a beast \u2014\nSHERLOCK\nTaught.\nBEZZA\nWhat?\nSHERLOCK\nHe taught you how to cut up a\nbeast.\n\n\nBEZZA\nYeah. Well.

I don\u2019t know how it\nhappened but it was an accident. I\nswear it!\nHe puts his head in his hands and sobs. Sherlock nods to a\nstocky BELARUS POLICEMAN and gets to his feet.\nBEZZA (CONT\u2019D)\nLook, you\u2019ve gotta help me, Mr\nHolmes. Everyone says you\u2019re the\nbest. Without you, I\u2019ll get hung\nfor this.\nSHERLOCK\nNo, no, no Mr Bewick. Not at all.\nBezza looks reassured.

LUCY\u2019S HOUSE. NIGHT.\n3\n3\nA very tidy, slightly beige house.\nA young man, WESTIE, and his girlfriend LUCY are watching TV.\nWestie looks troubled, distracted,\nLUCY\nIt\u2019s all right. Honestly. I know it\nwasn\u2019t your thing. Next time we\u2019ll\nwatch something with zombies.\nWESTIE\nWhat? Oh. Yeah.\n3.\n\n\nLUCY\nWhat is it, love? You\u2019ve been funny\nall -\nWestie gets up, goes to the window. Orange street light\nbleeds over his face.\nLUCY (CONT\u2019D)\nWhat\u2019s the matter? Westie?\nWESTIE\nLucy, love. I\u2019ve got to go out.\nLUCY\nWhat?\nWESTIE\nGot to see someone. It\u2019s important.\nDead important.\nLUCY\nYou\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you? It\u2019s so\nlate -\nWESTIE\nI\u2019ll get a cab. Won\u2019t be long.\nLUCY\nWhat? Who are you going to see?\nWESTIE\nIt can\u2019t wait. Sorry. Should\u2019ve\nsorted it (ages ago) -\nHe shakes his head.\nWESTIE (CONT\u2019D)\nSorry.\nHe grabs his coat then dashes back and kisses her.\nWESTIE (CONT\u2019D)\nLove you.\nLUCY\nWestie!\nWESTIE\nI won\u2019t be long.\nAnd he\u2019s gone.\nThe front door slams.

Open and shut domestic\nmurder. Not worth my time.\nJOHN\nShame. Anything in? I\u2019m starving.\nHe opens the fridge door.\nShoot through the back of the fridge to show -- the back of a\nbloodied head! John gawps and steps away.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nA head. A severed head.\nSHERLOCK\nJust tea for me, thanks.\nJOHN\nThere\u2019s a head in the fridge!\nSHERLOCK\nYes.\nJOHN\nA bloody head!\nSHERLOCK\nHad to put it somewhere. You don\u2019t\nmind, do you?

I thought you\u2019d\nbe...flattered.\nSHERLOCK\nFlattered?\n(reads from blog)\n\u201cSherlock sees right through\neveryone and everything in seconds.\nWhat\u2019s incredible, though is how\nspectacularly ignorant he is about\nsome things\u201d.\nJOHN\nHang on, I didn\u2019t mean -\nSHERLOCK\nWhat, you meant \u201cspectacularly\nignorant\u201d in a nice way? Look, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter to me who\u2019s Prime\nMinister. Or who\u2019s sleeping with\nwho -\nJOHN\nOr that the earth goes round the\nSun?\nSHERLOCK\nOh that again. It\u2019s not important.\nJOHN\nNot important! It\u2019s primary school\nstuff! How can you not know that?\nSHERLOCK\nIf I ever did, I\u2019ve deleted it.\nJOHN\nDeleted it?\nSHERLOCK\nListen -\nHe jabs a bony finger to his temple.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nTHIS is my hard drive. Only makes\nsense to put stuff in there that\u2019s\nuseful. Really useful. Ordinary\npeople fill their brains with all\nkinds of rubbish.\n6.\n(MORE)\n\n\nAnd then it\u2019s impossible to get at\nthe stuff that matters. You follow?\nJOHN\nBut it\u2019s the Solar System - !\nSHERLOCK\nWhat the hell does that matter? So\nwe go around the Sun! If we went\nround the Moon or ...round and\nround the garden like a teddy bear\nit wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\nAll that matters is the work.\nWithout it, my brain rots. Put that\nin your blog. Or, better still,\nstop inflicting your opinions on\nthe world.\nJohn glares at him - then heads for the door.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nWhere are you going?\nJOHN\nOut!\n(pointed)\nI need some air.\nHe makes to go, almost colliding with MRS HUDSON.\nMRS HUDSON\nOh, sorry, love.\nJOHN\nSorry -\nAnd he\u2019s gone. Mrs Hudson looks after his retreating back and\nthen over to Sherlock.\nMRS HUDSON\nYou two had a little...domestic?\nSherlock gets up and stares moodily out of the window. He\nwatches John leave the house.\nSHERLOCK\nLook at that, Mrs Hudson. Quiet.\nCalm. Peaceful. Isn\u2019t it hateful?\nMRS HUDSON\nI\u2019m sure something\u2019ll turn up,\nSherlock.\n(brightly)\nA nice murder!

His neck is stiff and he groans in pain.\nSARAH (O.S.)\nI told you to go with the li-lo.\nJohn tries to turn but his neck won\u2019t let him.\nJOHN\nOw!\nSARAH is behind the sofa holding out a mug of coffee.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nNo, no. It\u2019s fine. I slept fine. It\nwas very kind of you.\nSARAH\nNext time, maybe I\u2019ll let you sleep\non the end of the bed.\nJOHN\nAnd the time after that...?\nSarah smiles and snaps on the TV.\nSARAH\nDo you want some breakfast?\nJOHN\nGreat.\n8.\n\n\nSARAH\n(leaving)\nMind if I shower first?\nJOHN\nNo, no. Go ahead. I\u2019m in no hurry.\nHe\u2019s suddenly distracted by the TV. News footage of Baker\nStreet and the ruins where the empty house used to stand.\nSound of a shower from the next room.\nJohn\u2019s face falls.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\n(calling)\nSarah! Sarah!\nHe grabs his coat and rushes to the door.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nI\u2019ve got to go!

Hey.\n(unconvincing)\nHey!\nJim knocks into a kidney-dish which clatters to the floor.\nJIM\nSorry. Sorry.\nHe hands the dish back to Sherlock.

Nice to meet you.\n22.\n\n\nJOHN\nYou too.\nJIM goes out, smiling.\nMISS HOOPER\nWhat do you mean, gay? We\u2019re\ntogether.\nSHERLOCK\nAnd domestic bliss must suit you,\nMolly. You\u2019ve put on three pounds\nsince I last saw you.\nMISS HOOPER\n(mortified)\nTwo and a half!\nJOHN\nSherlock...\nMISS HOOPER\nHe\u2019s not gay! Why do you have to\nspoil - He\u2019s not!\nSHERLOCK\nWith that level of personal\ngrooming?\nJOHN\nWhat? A bit of product in his hair?\nI put product in my hair.\nSHERLOCK\nYou wash your hair. There\u2019s a\ndifference. No, no. Tinted\neyelashes, clear signs of taurine\ncream around the frown lines and\nthose tired, clubber\u2019s eyes. Then\nthere\u2019s his underwear.\nMISS HOOPER\nHis underwear?\nSHERLOCK\nVisible above his waist. Very\nvisible. Very particular brand.\nThat plus the extremely suggestive\nfact that he just dropped his phone\nnumber in this dish and I\u2019d say\nyou\u2019d better spare yourself the\npain and break if off now.\nMiss Hooper bursts into tears and runs out of the room.\n23.\n\n\nJOHN\nCharming. Well done.\nSHERLOCK\nJust saving her time. Isn\u2019t that\nkinder?\nJOHN\nKinder? No, Sherlock. That wasn\u2019t\nkind.\nHe looks anxiously at his watch.

Probably one of those\nretro designs.\nSHERLOCK\nYou\u2019re on sparkling form! What\nelse?\nJOHN\nThey\u2019re pretty big but -\nSherlock gives an encouraging smile to John. John suddenly\nbeams. Holds out the shoe. We see a completely blurred, felt-\ntipped name.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nThere\u2019s traces of a name inside! In\nfelt tip. Grown-ups don\u2019t put their\nnames in their shoes.

Scrubbed\nthem clean, whitened them where\nthey\u2019ve got discoloured and changed\nthe laces three...no, four times.\nEven so, there\u2019re traces of flaky\nskin where his fingers have come\ninto contact with them. So he\nsuffered from eczema. The trainers\nare well-worn but much more so on\nthe inner side. Which means the\nowner had weak arches.\nHe sniffs the shoes.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nBritish made. And twenty years old.\nJOHN\nTwenty years - ?\nSHERLOCK\nNot retro. They\u2019re original.\nHe flashes his PDA.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nLimited edition.

Analysis shows it\u2019s from\nSussex but with London mud\noverlaying it.\nJOHN\nHow do you know?\nSHERLOCK\n(gestures at microscope\nimage)\nPollen. Clear as a map reference to\nme. South of the river too. So the\nchild who owned these trainers came\nto London from Sussex twenty years\nago and left them behind.\nJOHN\nSo what happened to them?\nSHERLOCK\nSomething bad. He loved these\nshoes, remember? Wouldn\u2019t leave\nthem filthy. Wouldn\u2019t let them go\nunless he had no choice. So kid\nwith big feet gets - oh!\nJOHN\nWhat?\nSHERLOCK\n(pole-axed)\nCarl Powers!\nJOHN\nWho?\n26.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nCarl Powers!

It\u2019s the caffeine. How\nabout Camomile?\nSHERLOCK\nClever. Clever.\nMRS HUDSON\nWhat are you on about?\nJOHN enters. Sherlock looks up, thrilled.\nSHERLOCK\nClostridium botulinim.

The boy\nsuffered from eczema. It would be\nthe easiest thing in the world to\nintroduce the poison into his\nmedication. A few hours later he\ncame up to London for the swimming\ncompetition, the poison took\neffect, paralysed the muscles and\nhe drowned.\nJOHN\nHow come the autopsy didn\u2019t - ?\nSHERLOCK\nVirtually undetectable. And no-one\nwould\u2019ve been looking for it.\n(excited)\nBut there were tiny traces still\ninside the trainers. From where\nhe\u2019d rubbed the cream into his\nfeet.

A twenty and --\n-- the Colombian money.\nSHERLOCK (V.O.)\nHe told us he hadn\u2019t been abroad\nrecently but when I asked him about\nthe cars...\nEwart turns in his chair, bends low.\nClose on the back of his neck. It is deeply tanned but then\nthere\u2019s a clear white line visible some way down.\nSHERLOCK  (V.O.) (CONT\u2019D)\n...I could clearly see the tan-\nline. No-one wears a shirt on a sun-\nbed.

Like you.\n107.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nDear Jim, please could you fix it\nfor me to dispose of my boyfriend\u2019s\nnasty sister...?\nJim grins.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nDear Jim, please could you fix it\nfor me to disappear to South\nAmerica...?\nJIM\nJust so.\nSHERLOCK\nA consulting criminal! Brilliant!\nJIM\nIsn\u2019t it? No-one ever gets to me.\n(icy)\nAnd no-one ever will.\nSHERLOCK\nI did.\nJIM\nYou\u2019ve come the closest. But now\nyou\u2019re in my way.\nSHERLOCK\nThank you.\nJIM\nDidn\u2019t mean it as a compliment.\nSHERLOCK\nYes, you did.\nJIM\nYeah, okay, I did.  But the\nflirting\u2019s over, Sherlock.  Daddy\u2019s\nhad enough now. I\u2019ve shown you what\nI can do. I cut loose all those\npeople, all those little problems,\neven thirty million quid just to\nget you to come out and play. Did\nyou like the Czech Republic thing?\nThat\u2019s what you might call a\nleitmotif. Had you going there,\ndidn\u2019t I? But take this as a\nfriendly warning, my dear. Back\noff.\nSherlock smiles thinly.\n108.\n\n\nJIM (CONT\u2019D)\nYou know, I\u2019ve loved this. This\ngame of ours. It\u2019s been a treat.\nHe prods at his eye and removes a contact lens. His brown eye\nis now blue.\nJIM (CONT\u2019D)\nPlaying Jim from IT. Playing gay.\nDid you like the little touch? With\nthe underwear?\nSHERLOCK\nPeople have died.\nJIM\n(utter contempt)\nThat\u2019s what people do.\nBeat.\nSHERLOCK\nI will stop you.\nJIM\nNo. You won\u2019t.\nSherlock looks over at John.\nSHERLOCK\n(to John)\nYou ok?\nJohn doesn\u2019t move. Frozen with fear.\nJIM\nYou can talk, Johnny boy. Go ahead.\nOn John: hating the powerlessness. Then -- a small, tight\nnod.\nThe laser light still hovers over the explosives. Sherlock\nlooks at his friend -- and thrusts out the memory stick.\nSHERLOCK\nTake it!\nJIM\nWhat? Oh. That. Missile plans?\nBoring. Could\u2019ve picked them up any\ntime.\nJim takes the memory stick from Sherlock and tosses it in the\npool.\nSherlock moves forward instinctively. John seizes on the\ndistraction, rushes forward and throws his arms --\n109.\n\n\n-- around Jim! Now they\u2019re both a bomb.\nJIM (CONT\u2019D)\nOh, very good. Very good.\nThe laser light bobs confusedly over John\u2019s body.\nJOHN\n(hissing, to Jim)\nIf your sniper pulls that trigger,\nMr Moriarty, we both go up.\nJim\u2019s head oscillates again. He doesn\u2019t resist John\u2019s\nembrace. He is eerily calm.\nJIM\nIsn\u2019t he sweet? I can see why you\nlike having him around. But then,\npeople do get so sentimental about\ntheir pets.\n(to John)\nSo touchingly loyal. But - oops -\nyou\u2019ve rather shown your hand,\nthere, Dr Watson.\nHe nods towards the gallery. The laser lights moves off John\nand settles on Sherlock\u2019s temple.\nJIM (CONT\u2019D)\nGotcha.\nA new stand-off. Sherlock with the pistol trained on Jim. The\nexplosives-festooned John with his arms wrapped around Jim.\nThe sniper\u2019s rifle threatening Sherlock.\nOn John: defeated. Slowly, he lets Jim go and steps aside.\nThe laser light moves back onto John\u2019s body.\nJim straightens his suit.\nJIM (CONT\u2019D)\nTsk. Prada.\nHe beams at Sherlock.\nJIM (CONT\u2019D)\nDo you know what happens if you\ndon\u2019t leave me alone, Sherlock.  To\nyou?\nSHERLOCK\nOh, let me guess.  I\u2019ll be killed.\n110.\n\n\nJIM\nKilled, nah, don\u2019t be obvious.  I\nmean, I\u2019m gonna kill you anyway,\nsome day - don\u2019t want to rush it,\nthough, saving it up for something\nspecial.  No, if you don\u2019t stop\nprying, I will burn you.  I will\nburn the heart out of you.\nSHERLOCK\nI am reliably informed I don\u2019t have\none.\nJIM\nBut we both know that\u2019s not quite\ntrue.\nOn Sherlock: impassive.\nJIM (CONT\u2019D)\nWell, I\u2019d better be off. So nice to\nhave a proper chat.\nSHERLOCK\nWhat if I were to shoot you now?\nRight now?\nJIM\nThen you could cherish the look of\nsurprise on my face. Because I\nwould be surprised, Sherlock.\nReally I would. And just a teensy\nbit disappointed. \u2018Course, you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to cherish it for\nvery long.\nHe gives a cheerful wave.\nJIM (CONT\u2019D)\nCiao, Sherlock Holmes.\n-- and melts away into the shadows.\nSHERLOCK\n(calling)\nCatch you...later.\nJim calls without turning.\nJIM\nNo. You won\u2019t.\nHe goes. The door bangs behind him. Sherlock stares at John.\nJohn stares back. Then, suddenly, the red laser -- winks out.\nSherlock races up to John -\n111.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nAlright? You alright?\n- rips off the overcoat, tears the explosive from around him -\nJOHN\nYeah. Yeah, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine!\nSherlock -\nSherlock manically strips the explosives and hurls them away.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nSherlock!\nSherlock stops dead.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nIt\u2019s OK. I\u2019m OK.\nSherlock races off, throws open the door.\nSherlock\u2019s POV: a very empty corridor. Jim, long gone.\nJohn sinks to the tiled floor, exhausted.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nJesus.\nHe glances up at Sherlock.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nYou alright?\nSHERLOCK\nMe? Fine. I\u2019m fine.\nSherlock glances at John, a bit uncomfortably.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nThat was...what you did...what you\noffered to do. That was...\n(difficult word)\n...good.\nJohn shrugs. John gazes down at his ragged clothes.\nJOHN\nGlad no-one saw that.\nSHERLOCK\nHm?\nJOHN\nYou ripping all my clothes off in a\ndarkened swimming pool. People\nmight talk.\n112.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nThey do little else.\nThey look at each other. A small smile.\nThen, suddenly. Another laser light winks into life on John.\nThen one on Sherlock. Then another and another and another\nuntil both men are covered in tiny, bobbing red lights.\nJIM (O.S.)\nSorry, boys. I am so changeable.\nIt\u2019s a weakness with me. But, to be\nfair, it\u2019s my only weakness.\nJim is upstairs in the gallery, half-glimpsed.\nJIM (CONT\u2019D)\nYou can\u2019t be allowed to continue.\nYou just can\u2019t.\n(sighs)\nI would try to convince you\nbut...everything I have to say has\nalready crossed your mind.\nSherlock looks over at John.\nA moment between them.\nJohn nods.\nThen Sherlock aims his gun at the massive pile of Semtex he\u2019s\njust taken off John.\nSHERLOCK\nThen possibly my answer has crossed\nyours.\nClose: Countless laser sights hovering over Sherlock and\nJohn.\nJohn: a soldier, alert to every move.\nJim: a tiny smile.\nSherlock: totally focussed. Hand steady as a rock.\nHe cocks the gun.\nEND\n113."
