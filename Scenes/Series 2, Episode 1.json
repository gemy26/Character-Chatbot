Pretty racy\nfor first thing on a Monday\nmorning, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve written a\nlittle blog about the\nidentification of perfumes. It\u2019s\non the website. You should look\nit up!\nMRS HUDSON\nPlease -\nSHERLOCK\nI wouldn\u2019t pin your hopes on that\ncruise with Mr Chatterjee.

It\u2019s so placid! So\nstraightforward. Barely used.\nA look from John. Cheers.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nMine\u2019s like an engine. Racing. Out\nof control. A rocket, trapped on\nthe launch pad, tearing itself to\npieces. I need a case!!\nJOHN\nYou\u2019ve just solved one! By\nharpooning a dead pig, apparently!\nSHERLOCK\nThat was this morning. Where\u2019s the\nnext one??\nJOHN\nNothing on the website?\nSherlock grabs an open laptop and shoves it at John.\nSHERLOCK\n\u201cDear Sherlock Holmes. I can\u2019t\nfind Bluebell anywhere.

Before it\ndisappeared, Bluebell turned\nluminous! Like a fairy - according\nto little Kirsty. Then the next\nmorning, Bluebell was gone, hutch\nstill locked, no sign of forced\nentry - what am I say this is\nbrilliant!\n(Grabs laptop)\nPhone Lestrade, tell him there\u2019s an\nescaped rabbit!\nJOHN\nYou\u2019re kidding.\nSHERLOCK\nIt\u2019s this or Cluedo.\nJOHN\nNo. We\u2019re never playing that\nagain.\nSHERLOCK\nWhy not?\nJOHN\nBecause it\u2019s not actually\npossible for the victim to have\ndone it, Sherlock, that\u2019s why.\nSHERLOCK\nI couldn\u2019t see any other\nsolution.\nJOHN\nIt\u2019s not in the rules!\nSHERLOCK\nThen the rule are wrong!\nThe doorbell downstairs buzzes.

Bleak. Wild. Wind howls.\nPRESENTER V/O\nDartmoor. It\u2019s always been a\nplace of myth and legend. But is\nthere something else lurking out\nthere? Something very real?\nShaky, hand-held, drive by shots of a grim-looking military\ncompound. \u2018Keep Out\u2019 signs and barbed wire everywhere.\nPRESENTER V/O (CONT\u2019D)\nBecause Dartmoor is also home to\none of the Government\u2019s most\nsecretive operations. The chemical\nand biological weapons research\ncentre that\u2019s said to be even more\nsensitive than Porton Down. Since\nthe end of the second  world war,\nthere have been persistent stories\nabout the Baskerville experiments.\nClose on a battered, tree-screened M.O.D. sign:\nBASKERVILLE.\nNow (if possible) on hillside with the military compound\nvisible beyond him.\nPRESENTER\nGenetic mutations. Animals grown\nfor the battlefield. There are\nmany who believe that within this\ncompound, in the heart of this\nancient wilderness, there are\nhorrors beyond imagining ...\nCloser on the presenter now - dramatic emphasis.\nPRESENTER (CONT\u2019D)\n... but the real question is, are\nall of them still inside?\nThe documentary now cuts to Henry, sitting in his messy front\ndoor. Shaking - neurotic but determined, a man recalling\nterrible memories. As he speaks, a caption comes up:\nHENRY KNIGHT\nHENRY\nI was just a kid. It was on the\nmoor, it was dark, but I know what\nI saw. I know what killed my\nfather.\nAnd the image freezes.\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  9.\n\n\nINT. BAKER STREET. DAY.\n12\n12\n-- on the TV in Baker Street.\nSHERLOCK has the remote.\nSHERLOCK\nWhat did you see?\nThere\u2019s a newcomer in the sitting room - HENRY KNIGHT (20s,\nnervy) the man from the documentary. He points, slightly\nfeebly, at the screen.\nHENRY\nI was just about to say.\nSHERLOCK\nYes, in a TV interview. I prefer to\ndo my own editing.\nHe snaps the television off.\nHENRY\nYes. Sorry, yes, of course.\nHe takes out a scrunched up paper napkin and rubs his nose,\ndislodging all kinds of rubbish from his pocket. He stuffs\nthe napkin away.\nJOHN\nIn your own time.\nSHERLOCK\nBut quite quickly.\nHENRY\nDo you know Dartmoor, Mr. Holmes?\nSHERLOCK\nNo.\nHENRY\nIt\u2019s an amazing place. Like nowhere\nelse - sort of bleak but beautiful -\nSHERLOCK\nYes, don\u2019t care, moving on.\nHENRY\nWe used to go for walks - after my\nMum died, my Dad and me, every\nevening we\u2019d go out on the moor-\nSHERLOCK\nYes, good, skipping on to the night\nhe was violently killed - where did\nit happen?\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  10.\n\n\nHENRY\nThere\u2019s a place - a sort of local\nlandmark - called Dewer\u2019s Hollow.\n(A beat - grim)\nThat\u2019s an ancient name for the\ndevil.\nSHERLOCK\nSo?\nHenry flusters in the face of Sherlock\u2019s indifference.\nJOHN\nDid you see the devil that night?\nHENRY\n... yes.\nCUT TO:\nFLASHBACK\nExpressionistic flashes. Red eyes! Snapping jaws! Muscle and\nfur! A man thrashing under a savage attack. Now blood\nspattering across the screen and --\nCUT TO:\nHenry, shaken at the memory.\nHENRY\nIt got him. Tore at him. Tore his\nthroat out.\n(shrugs)\nI can\u2019t remember anything else.\nThey found me the next morning.\nJust wandering on the moor. My\nDad\u2019s body was never found.\nJohn looks at the notes he\u2019s been taking.\nJOHN\nRed eyes. Coal black fur. Enormous.\n(To Sherlock)\nA dog? A wolf?\nSHERLOCK\nA genetic experiment?\nHenry looks at him, sharply, catching something in his tone.\nHENRY\nAre you laughing at me, Mr. Holmes?\nSHERLOCK\nWhy, are you joking?\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  11.\n\n\nHENRY\nMy Dad was always going on about\nthe things they were doing at\nBaskerville. What kind of\nmonsters they might be breeding.\nPeople used to laugh at him too.\nAt least the TV people took me\nseriously.\nSHERLOCK\nAnd I\u2019m sure did wonders for Devon\ntourism.\nColour now springing into Henry\u2019s cheeks. What??\nJOHN\nWhatever happened to your father,\nit was twenty years ago. Why come\nto us now?\nBut Henry has already sprung to his feet.\nHENRY\nNot sure you can help me, Mr.\nHolmes - since you find it all so\nfunny!\nSHERLOCK\n(Answering John)\nBecause of what happened last\nnight.\nJOHN\n... sorry, what? What happened last\nnight?\nHenry is staring at Sherlock now.\nHENRY\nHow did you know?\nSHERLOCK\nI didn\u2019t know - I noticed. You\u2019ve\ncome up from Devon by the first\navailable train this morning. You\nhad a disappointing breakfast and a\ncup of black coffee. A girl in the\nseat across the aisle fancied you\nbut, although you were initially\nkeen, you\u2019ve now changed your mind.\nYou are, though, extremely anxious\nto have your first cigarette of the\nday. Sit down, Mr Knight. And do\nplease smoke. I\u2019d be delighted.\nUnless you still think I can\u2019t be\nof help to you?\nHenry looks astonished. Then relapses back into his chair.\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  12.\n\n\nHENRY\nHow could you \u201cnotice\u201d all that?\nJOHN\nHe\u2019ll tell you later. It\u2019s not\nimportant --\nSherlock nods towards the floor.\nSHERLOCK\nPunched-out holes from where your\nticket\u2019s been checked.\nJOHN\nNot now, Sherlock.\nSHERLOCK\nOh go on. I\u2019ve been cooped up in\nhere for ages.\nJOHN\nYou\u2019re just showing off.\nSHERLOCK\nOf course! I\u2019m a show off! That\u2019s\nwhat we do!\nHe leans over and pulls out the paper napkin from Henry\u2019s\npocket.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nTrain napkin which you\u2019ve used to\nmop up spilled coffee. Strength\nof the stain shows you didn\u2019t\ntake milk. There are traces of\nketchup on it and round your lips\nand on your sleeve. Cooked\nbreakfast. Or the nearest thing\nthose trains can manage. Probably\na sandwich.\nHENRY\nHow do you know it was...\ndisappointing?\nSHERLOCK\nIs there any other kind of\nbreakfast on a train? The girl --\nfemale handwriting\u2019s quite\ndistinctive -- wrote down her\nphone number on the napkin. I can\nsee from the angle she wrote at\nthat she was sitting across from\nyou on the other side of the\naisle. Later - after she\u2019d got\noff I imagine - you used the\nnapkin to mop up your coffee and\naccidentally smudged the number.\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  13.\n(MORE)\n\n\nYou\u2019ve gone over the last four\ndigits yourself with another pen\nso you wanted to keep the number.\nJust a moment ago, though, you\nused the napkin to blow your\nnose. Maybe you\u2019re not that into\nher after all. Then there\u2019s the\nnicotine stains on your fingers.\nYour shaking fingers. I know the\nsigns. No chance to smoke on the\ntrain, no time to roll one before\nyou got the cab here. You\u2019re\ndesperate. It\u2019s now a little\nafter 9.15. The first train from\nExeter to London is at 5.46 am.\nYou got the first one possible so\nsomething important must\u2019ve\nhappened last night. Am I wrong?\nBeat.\nHENRY\nNo. You\u2019re right. You\u2019re exactly\nright. Bloody hell. I heard you\nwere quick.\nSHERLOCK\nIt\u2019s my job. Now shut up and\nsmoke!\nHenry takes out a packet of Rizlas, rolls a cigarette and\nlights up. The smoke drifts. Sherlock, not so subtly,\ninhales.\nJohn shoots him a disapproving look, then turns to Henry.\nHis approach is careful and gentle, full of genuine bedside\nmanner.\nJOHN\n(gently)\nSo you lost both parents. And you\nwere only - what? - seven years\nold. It must\u2019ve been quite a trauma\n...\nHENRY\nNo -\nJOHN\nHave you thought maybe you invented\nthis story, this ... big bad wolf,\nto account for it?\nHENRY\nThat\u2019s what Dr. Mortimer says.\nJOHN\nWho?\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  14.\nSHERLOCK (CONT'D)\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nHis therapist.\nHENRY\nMy therapist.\nSHERLOCK\nObviously!\nHENRY\nLouise Mortimer. She\u2019s the reason I\ncame back to Dartmoor. She thinks I\nhave to ... face my demons.\nSHERLOCK\nAnd when you returned to Scratch\u2019s\nHollow last night, what happened?\nYou went there on the advice of a\ntherapist, and now you\u2019re\nconsulting a detective - what did\nyou see, that changed everything?\nHENRY\n... It\u2019s a strange place, the\nHollow - makes you feel so cold\ninside - so afraid -\nSHERLOCK\nIf I wanted poetry, I\u2019d read John\u2019s\nemails to his girlfriends - much\nfunnier. What did you see?\nHENRY\nFootprints. On the exact spot where\nI saw my father torn apart.\nJOHN\nA man\u2019s or a woman\u2019s.\nHENRY\nNeither.  They were -\nSHERLOCK\nIs that all? Anything else -\nfootprints, is that it?\nHENRY\nYes, but they were -\nSHERLOCK\nSorry, Dr. Mortimer wins - it\u2019s a\nchildhood trauma masked by an\ninvented memory. Boring. Goodbye,\nMr. Knight - thankyou for smoking.\nSherlock is now striding through the back, as if to his\nbedroom.\nHENRY\nBut what about the footprints?\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  15.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nPaw-prints, I assume, Could be\nanything - therefore nothing. Off\nto Devon with you - have a cream\ntea on me.\nStarts heading away again.\nHENRY\nMr. Holmes ... they were the\nfootprints of a gigantic hound!\nOn the back of Sherlock\u2019s head as he jolts to a halt. Now\nturns slowly. Now he\u2019s looking at Henry, now he\u2019s interested.\nSHERLOCK\nSay that again.\nHENRY\nI found paw prints - they were big,\nthey were - ...\nSHERLOCK\nNo, no. Your exact words. Repeat\nyour exact words from a moment ago,\nexactly as you said them.\nOn Henry. Puzzled, a little self-conscious. Exchanges a look\nwith an equally bewildered John - who just nods. Do as he\nsays.\nHENRY\nMr. Holmes ... they were the\nfootprints of a gigantic hound.\nOn Sherlock: eyes gleaming, mind whirling.\nSHERLOCK\n... I\u2019ll take the case.\nJOHN\nSorry, what?\nSHERLOCK\nThank you for bringing this to my\nattention, it\u2019s very promising.\nJOHN\nNo, sorry, what?? A minute ago\nfootprints were boring, now they\u2019ve\nvery promising!\nSHERLOCK\nIt\u2019s nothing to do with the\nfootprints. As ever, John, you\nweren\u2019t listening. This place,\nBaskerville - ever heard of it?\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  16.\n\n\nJOHN\nVaguely. Very hush-hush.\nSHERLOCK\nSounds like a good place to\nstart.\nHENRY\nYou\u2019ll come down then?\nBeat. Sherlock looks at John.\nSHERLOCK\nNo, I can\u2019t leave London at the\nmoment, far too busy. But don\u2019t\nworry, I\u2019m sending my best man.\n(Claps John on the\nshoulder)\nI know I can rely on John to send\nme all the relevant data as he\nnever understands a word of it\nhimself.\nJOHN\nWhat\u2019re you talking about, you\u2018re\ntoo busy?? You haven\u2019t got any\ncases! You were just complaining -\nSHERLOCK\nBluebell. I\u2019ve got Bluebell. The\ncase of the vanishing glow-in-the-\ndark rabbit.\n(To Henry)\nNATO is in uproar.\nHENRY\nSorry. You\u2019re not coming then?\nOh John - resigned, getting it.\nJOHN\nOkay. Okay.\nJohn sighs hugely, goes over to the mantelpiece, lifts up\nthe skull and retrieves Sherlock\u2019s emergency packet of\ncigarettes. He tosses them over.\nSherlock catches them, laughs and chucks them over his\nshoulder.\nSHERLOCK\nDon\u2019t need \u2018em any more, I\u2019m going\nto Dartmoor.\nHENRY\nSorry - you are coming?\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  17.\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nA twenty year old disappearance!\nA monster Hound!

Saw\nit as my imagination expected me\nto see it. A genetically\nengineered monster! I knew I\ncouldn\u2019t believe the evidence of\nmy own eyes. There were seven\npossible reasons for it, the most\nlikely being a narcotic. Henry\nKnight saw the Hound too. But you\ndidn\u2019t, John. You didn\u2019t. We\u2019d\neaten and drunk the same things\nsince we came to Grimpen, except\nfor one thing. You don\u2019t take\nsugar in your coffee.\nHe points angrily at the smashed slide.\nJOHN\nI see. So --\nSHERLOCK\nI took that from Henry\u2019s kitchen.\nHis sugar. But it\u2019s perfectly\nalright.\nJOHN\nMaybe it isn\u2019t a drug?\nSHERLOCK\nIt must be! But how did it get\ninto our systems? How?\nHe throws himself down into a chair. Puts his head in his\nhands.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\n(sighs)\nThere\u2019s something...something\nburied deep.\nHe sits back in the chair. Closes his eyes and steeples his\nfingertips.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nGet out.\nSTAPLETON\nWhat?\nSHERLOCK\nI need to go to my mind palace.\nGet out.\nHOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE - SIDES - 30/05/11  85.\n\n\nSTAPLETON\nYour what?\nBut he doesn\u2019t answer. John sighs.\nJOHN\nHe\u2019s not going to be doing much\ntalking for a while. We might as\nwell go.\nSTAPLETON\nHis what?\nJOHN\nMind palace. It\u2019s a memory\ntechnique. A sort of mental map.\nYou map out a location. Doesn\u2019t\nhave to be a real place. Then\nyou...deposit memories there.\nTheoretically, you can never\nforget anything.
