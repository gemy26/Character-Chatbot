He points into the corner.\nSHERLOCK\nHey.\nThis time the trick fails miserably - the CHINESE WARLORD\njust punches him in the gob.\nHe grabs the paint can and uses it as a weapon - spraying\nit into the WARLORD\u2019S eyes.\nThe WARLORD swings his razor sword at SHERLOCK\u2019S head.\nSHERLOCK ducks and the sword embeds itself in the plaster\nwall.\nSHERLOCK seizes the moment.

She\nruns over to rescue JOHN from the dusty chaos.\nSHERLOCK rips a shoe from the WARLORD. He gazes there at a\ntattoo on the man\u2019s heel. The Black Lotus.\nBut the WARLORD is not concussed - merely stunned. He kicks\nout at SHERLOCK and staggers to his feet; dizzy; still\nbrandishing a sword.\nFrom the wings the OPERA SINGER appears - something in her\nhand. She points it at JOHN.
