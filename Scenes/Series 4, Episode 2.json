ELSA\u2019S HOUSE - DAY13\n13\nJohn comes striding out of the front door of a neat little\nsuburban house, in a nice little housing estate (Elsa\u2019s\nconsulting room is in her home.)\nHe finds:\nTwo police cars. They\u2019ve screeched to a halt.\nAbove, a helicopter.\nAnd parked at a crazy angle on the font lawn, is a red sports\ncar, the driver\u2019s door swinging open -\nClose on John, staring at who is emerging from the car -\nastonished.\nElsa is now at his shoulder.\nELSA\nWell now! Won\u2019t you introduce me?\nJohn, stepping forward into close up. Whoever he\u2019s staring,\nhe can\u2019t quite believe it. The last person he expected!\nCUT TO:\nOPENING TITLES\n14\n14\nINT. BOARD ROOM - NIGHT\n15\n15\nAt the windows, night time London, far below. Over this:\nTHREE YEARS AGO.\nWe are looking through at window. Reflected, out of focus, a\nman, staring out. We can make out a slight, bald figure.\nThere is a murmur of conversation in this room, a gentle\nhubbub.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 2 - GREEN AMENDMENTS 10.06.16\n6.\nCONTINUED:\n12\n12\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nCORNELIA\nMr. Smith?\nRoll focus, fast! The reflected figure snaps into sharpness.\nA gleaming bald head, almost eerily hairless. Black,\nsparkling eyes, and a gleeful rictus smile crammed with a\njumble of miss-matched teeth.\nThis is Culverton Smith.\nHe turns to the woman who spoke at his shoulder, and it\u2019s\nlike he threw a switch, because the goblin grin is gone. He\nlooks restrained, solemn, wise. Just a little dead-eyed.\nNow, very fast, almost subliminal, barely more than blips - a\nset of fast-cutting video clips, too close on the screen,\nliney and grainy -\n- Culverton Smith laughing on a chat show -\n- Culverton Smith being interviewed on a red carpet\n- Culverton Smith talking earnestly on Newsnight.\n(We will use these Video Blips as punctuation throughout -\nwhen Culverton Smith is seen or mentioned. It\u2019s as if his\nfame has impact, a jumble of associations. Like when you meet\nsomeone famous and you can\u2019t help thinking of the times\nyou\u2019ve seen them.)\nWider: Cornelia his PA, is a few feet behind him.\nCORNELIA\nWhenever you\u2019re ready.\nCulverton Smith looks round the room.\nSix people, three men, three women.\nCloser on one of the women, laughing. This is Faith. She\nlooks vital, nervy. Blonde (or light coloured) hair, brightly\ncoloured spectacles. In her thirties. In one hand she grips a\nwalking cane. Like her clothes, it is stylish, ever-so-\nslightly flamboyant. As Culverton Smith looks at her, she\nthrows back her head and laughs at something someone just\nsaid.\nCulverton Smith smiles for a moment, fondly, maybe a little\nsadly -\n- then turns back to Cornelia.\nCULVERTON SMITH\nNow please.\nCornelia nods\nCulverton Smith turns back to the window -\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 2 - GREEN AMENDMENTS 10.06.16\n7.\nCONTINUED:\n15\n15\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\n- as his face swings back into the reflection, that grin is\nback.\nOn Cornelia, turning, phone discreetly at her ear.\nCORNELIA\nBring them through.\nHe steps out of shot. Leaving us with a shot of two magazine\ncovers. Culverton Smith grins from the cover of the Radio\nTimes (\u201dBack in Business\u201d) and glowers from a copy of Time\n(\u201dSerious Money\u201d.)\nCUT TO:\nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY\n16\n16\nA thick-set SECURITY MAN folding his phone away.\nWider: a long, quiet corridor in the same building - rows of\nwindows, rows of doors, silent. Semi-darkness - the only\nlight glimmers from the streets outside, and streams through\nthe one opened door.  The Security Man stands opposite this\ndoor.\nHe glances through the door, gives a little nod to someone.\nThe squeaking of wheels. Now an eerie procession out of the\ndoor.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 2 - GREEN AMENDMENTS 10.06.16\n8.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n15\n15\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nNurses, gloved, gowned, face-masked - and each one pushing\nhospital drip feed.

BOARD ROOM - NIGHT\n17\n17\nCULVERTON SMITH, now standing at the end of the meeting\ntable. The others are seated round it - six of them. Three\nmen, three women.\nCulverton moving round the table. As he passes each person,\nhe makes some contact with them - squeezing a shoulder,\npatting a back.\nCULVERTON SMITH\nFriends are people you want to\nshare with. Friends and family.\nOn the word \u201cfamily\u201d he\u2019s passing behind Faith. A squeeze of\nthe shoulder, and smile from Faith.\nCUT TO:\nINT.

BOARD ROOM - NIGHT\n17B\n17B\nCulverton, at the end of the table now, hands spreading - a\nman making a reasonable appeal.\nCULVERTON SMITH (V.O.)\nBut here\u2019s a question: what\u2019s the\nvery worst thing you can do to your\nvery best friends?\nAn exchange of glances round the table. Ivan smiles,\nfriendly.\nIVAN\nSomething on your mind?\nCULVERTON SMITH\nYes. Oh, yes.\nSHERLOCK IV - EPISODE 2 - GREEN AMENDMENTS 10.06.16\n9.\nCONTINUED:\n16\n16\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nIVAN\nAnything you tell us, stays in this\nroom. I think I speak for everyone.\nA murmur of assent. Loyal friends, a little offended that he\nwould.\nFAITH\nWell? What is the worst thing you\ncould do?\nCULVERTON SMITH\nTell them your darkest\nsecret.\nMore glances. Questions forming on lips.\nCULVERTON SMITH (CONT\u2019D)\nBecause if you tell them ... and\nthey decide they\u2019d rather not know\n... you can\u2019t take it back. You\ncan\u2019t un-say it. Once you open your\nheart, you can\u2019t close it again.\nSilence now. What the hell is he talking about? On Culverton-\nSmith. Smirks.\nCULVERTON SMITH (CONT\u2019D)\nKidding! Of course you can!\nHe gives a little nod to Cornelia, who steps to the door,\nopens it -\n- we can\u2019t see into the shadowed corridor - but we hear the\nsqueaking of the approaching casters.\nThey all stare as the nurses start wheeling the drip feed\nunits into the room,\nCULVERTON SMITH (CONT\u2019D)\nPlease roll up your right sleeves.\n(Smiles, amiable)\nJust a little bit of insurance.\nThe nurses as they move calmly round the room, positioning\neach dripfeed behind an occupied chair.\nOn Faith: her earlier cheeriness gone, now a little thrown.\nStaring at the bags, curious and unnerved. It comes out as\nbelligerence.\nFAITH\nI don\u2019t understand. What is that?\nIVAN\nTD 12.\nIvan: bemused, as he stares at the bags. Like he\u2019s surprised\nto see them here.
