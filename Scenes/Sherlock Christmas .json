You have come to\nthis agency as a last resort, in\nhope that reconciliation may still\nbe possible.\nJOHN\nGood lord, Holmes.\nSHERLOCK\nAll this is, of course, perfectly\nevident from your perfume. Pray be\nseated.\nJOHN\nHer perfume?\nThey are now in the accustomed chair - the woman in the\nclient chair, facing the fireplace.\nSHERLOCK\nHer perfume, yes - which brings\ninsight to me, and disaster to you.\nJOHN\nHow so?\nSHERLOCK\nBecause I recognised it -\nHe leans over and throws back the lady\u2019s veil -\n- revealing Mary Watson.

This causes Mary\nand John to startle and turn to look at him. Sherlock throws\naside the violin, looks fiercely out of the window.\nSHERLOCK\nEnough! The stage is set, the\ncurtain rises - we are ready to\nbegin.\nMary and John exchange a look.\nMARY\nBegin what?\nSherlock is staring out of the window. Abstracted, haunted.\nSHERLOCK\nSometimes to solve a case, one must\nfirst solve another.\nJOHN\nYou have a case then? A new one?\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n12.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nAn old one. Very old. I shall have\nto go deep.\nJOHN\nDeep? Into what?\nOh Sherlock, still staring out of the window.\nWe move in on the window, the Victorian evening outside, the\ngas lamps, the cabs.\nSHERLOCK\nMyself!\nAbruptly, we roll focus to bring Sherlock\u2019s reflection into\nfocus for a fleeting  moment -\n- barely long enough to realise we are looking at modern\nSherlock, in his coat and turned up collar -\n- this spectre of the future hangs above the Victorian street\nscene for the tiniest moment -\n- and before we are sure what we are looking at -\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nLestrade!\nHe spins round from the window, now back to his Victorian\nself.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nDo stop loitering by the door and\ncome in.\nThe door pushes open - revealing the Victorian version of\nInspector Lestrade, complete with mutton chop whiskers and\nDerby hat.\nLESTRADE\nHow did you know it was me?\nSHERLOCK\nThe regulation tread is\nunmistakable. Too light for Jones,\ntoo heavy for Gregson.\nLESTRADE\nSorry - I just came up, Mrs. Hudson\ndidn\u2019t seem to be ... talking.\nSHERLOCK\nI fear she has branched into\nliterary criticism by means of\nsatire - it is a distressing trend\nin the modern landlady.

Come to astonish us with your\nmagic tricks, I suppose.\nSHERLOCK\nIs there anything to which you\u2019d\nlike to draw my attention?\nHOOPER\nNothing at all, Mr. Holmes. You may\nleave any time you wish.\nLESTRADE\nDr. Hooper, I asked Mr. Holmes to\ncome here - co-operate. That\u2019s an\norder.\nHooper shoots him a sour look - oh, all right.\nHOOPER\nThere are two \u201cfeatures of\ninterest\u201d as you\u2019re always saying\nin Dr Watson\u2019s stories.\nSHERLOCK\nI never say that.\nJOHN\nYou do, actually. Quite a lot.\nHOOPER\nFirst of all, this is definitely\nEmelia Ricoletti. She has been\ncategorically identified. Beyond\ndoubt, this is her.\nJOHN\nThen who was that in Limehouse last\nnight?\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n28.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nHOOPER\nThat was also Emelia Ricoletti.\nJOHN\nIt can\u2019t have been. She was dead,\nshe was here.\nHOOPER\nShe was positively identified by\nher own husband seconds before he\ndied. He had no reason to lie, and\ncould hardly have been mistaken.\nLESTRADE\nThe cabbie knew her too. No\nquestion it was her.\nSherlock, now frowning. This is tricky.\nJOHN\nBut she can\u2019t have been in two\nplaces at the same time, can she?\nSHERLOCK\nNo, Watson. One place is strictly\nthe limit for the recently\ndeceased.\nJOHN\nHolmes! Could it have been twins?\nSHERLOCK\nNo.\nJOHN\nWhy not?\nSHERLOCK\nBecause it\u2019s never twins.\nLESTRADE\nEmelia was not a twin, nor did she\nhave any sisters. She had one older\nbrother who died four years ago.\nJOHN\nWell - maybe there was a ... secret\ntwin?\nSHERLOCK\nA what??\nJOHN\nYou know. A secret twin. A twin,\nthat nobody knew about. This whole\nthing could\u2019ve been planned..\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n29.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nSince the moment of conception? How\nbreathtakingly prescient of her.\nIt\u2019s never twins, Watson.\nJOHN\nThen what\u2019s your theory?\nSHERLOCK\nMore to the point -\n(Rounds on Lestrade)\nWhat\u2019s your problem?\nLESTRADE\nI don\u2019t understand.\nSHERLOCK\nWhy were you so frightened? Nothing\nso far has justified your assault\non my decanter. You\u2019ve allowed a\ndead body to be placed under arrest\n...\nHOOPER\nAh. That would be the other feature\nof interest.\nHooper has raised the right hand of the dead woman,\nindicating a smear of blood on the forefinger.\nJOHN\nA smear of blood on the finger?\nThat could\u2019ve happened any number\nof ways.\nHOOPER\nOh, indeed. There\u2019s just one thing.\nIt wasn\u2019t there earlier.\nLestrade has picked up a gas lamp from a table, now raises it\nto illuminate something on the wall ...\nLESTRADE\nAnd neither was that!\nThe word YOU is smeared in blood on the wall.\nThey all stare. Sherlock, in particular, is fascinated. And\nsilent.\nJOHN\n... Holmes? Say something.\nWhen Sherlock speaks, he is staring at the words - haunted,\nthrilling to the moment.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n30.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nA gun in the mouth. A bullet\nthrough the brain. The back of the\nhead blown clean off. How could he\nsurvive?\nThe others exchange glances.\nJOHN\n\u201cShe\u201d, you mean?\nSHERLOCK\n... I\u2019m sorry?\nJOHN\nNot \u201che\u201d. \u201cShe\u201d.\nSHERLOCK\n... yes. Yes, of course.\n(Brightens, back to\nbusiness)\nThank you, all, for a fascinating\ncase. I\u2019ll send you a telegram when\nI\u2019ve solved it. Watson!\nAnd he sweeps out of the room -\n- as he passes a mirror, we seem fleetingly reflected - but\nagain as the modern Sherlock, in his coat and scarf. As last\ntime, this is so fast we can\u2019t be sure.\nJohn turns to Hooper. With Sherlock gone, he\u2019s slightly\ndifferent - crisper, more business-like.\nJOHN\nThe gunshot wound was obviously the\ncause of death, but there are some\nclear indicators of consumption.\nMight be worth a post-mortem, we\nneed all the information we can\nget.\nHOOPER\nOh, isn\u2019t he observant, now that\nDaddy\u2019s gone.\nJOHN\nI\u2019m observant in some ways -\n(Lands such a level gaze\non her)\n- just as Holmes is quite blind in\nothers.\nHOOPER\nReally?\nJOHN\nYes. Really.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n31.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nHe holds Hooper\u2019s look for a moment - then very pointedly,\nraises his hat to her. As he might, if there were a lady\npresent.\nHooper almost blushes. He\u2019s on to her.\nJohn claps his hat back on, and sweeps out after Sherlock.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\n(As he goes)\nAmazing what one has to do to get\nahead in a man\u2019s world!\nANDERSON\nWhat\u2019s he saying that for?\nHOOPER\nGet back to work!\nDISSOLVE TO:\nINT.

Surely you must have\nsome theory??\nA silence. Then:\nSHERLOCK\nNot yet. These are deep waters,\nWatson, deep waters.\n(Frowns abstracted)\nAnd I shall have to go deeper still\n...\nAnd he falls into silence, staring abstractedly out of the\nwindow.\nNow on Watson, watching him - frowning, troubled.\nJOHN (V.O.)\nIt was not for several months that\nwe were to pick up the threads of\nthis strange case again...\nCUT TO:\nINT. 221B BAKER STREET.

Who have I been\ntalking to all this time?\nLESTRADE\nWell speaking on behalf of the\nimpossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard,\nthat chair is definitely empty.\nSHERLOCK\nYes, it is.

Then, from off, the familiar voice:\nMORIARTY\n(From off)\nEverything I have to say has\nalready crossed your mind.\nCloser on Sherlock - those eyes still closed.\nSHERLOCK\nThen possibly my answer has crossed\nyours.\nMORIARTY\nLike a bullet!!\nClose on Sherlock\u2019s eyes: slo-mo as they snap open, to the\ndistant dreamy sound of a gun shot.\nSherlock\u2019s POV. Standing at the window, framed against the\ngaslight -\n- the silhouette of Moriarty.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nIt is a dangerous habit to finger\nloaded firearms in the pocket of\none\u2019s dressing gown ...\nMoriarty, stepping forward into the light, demonic.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\n... or are you just pleased to see\nme?\nDressed in a respectably sober black frock-coat with a stiff\nImperial collar, the face is familiar, even though he has a\nneat black beard. His head oscillates from side to side like\na lizard\u2019s. MORIARTY!\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n79.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nSherlock smiles.\nSHERLOCK\nYou\u2019ll forgive me taking\nprecautions.\nHe takes the gun from his pocket, trains it on Moriarty\nMORIARTY\nI\u2019d be offended if you didn\u2019t -\nobviously I have returned the\ncourtesy.\nHe has plucked a gun from his pockets. He waves it\nnegligently, as if it was no more than pen or pointer. As he\ntalks he gestures with it - strokes his chin with it,\nscratches his head. As if completely unaware of its deadly\npotential. (Basically, he\u2019s taking the piss out the gun that\nSherlock has pointed at him.)\nHe is now strolling about, relaxed, unconcerned.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nI like your rooms, they smell so\n... manly.\nSHERLOCK\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve acquainted yourself\nwith them before now.\nMORIARTY\nWell, you\u2019re always away having\nyour little adventures for the\nStrand. Does the illustrator travel\nwith you? Do you have to pose\nduring your cases?\nSHERLOCK\nI\u2019ve been fully aware of the six\noccasions when you have visited\nthese apartments, during my\nabsence.\nMORIARTY\nI know. By the way, you have a\nsurprisingly comfortable bed.\n(Sweeps a finger a long a\nsurface, looks at the\nsmudge on his finger)\nDid you know that dust is largely\ncomposed of human skin?\nSHERLOCK\nYes.\nMORIARTY\n(Licks his finger)\nDoesn\u2019t taste the same though.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n80.\n(MORE)\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nYou want skin fresh. Just a little\ncrispy.\nSHERLOCK\nWon\u2019t you sit down?\nMORIARTY\n(Ignoring him)\nThat\u2019s all people really are, you\nknow - dust waiting to be\ndistributed. And it gets\neverywhere. In every breath you\ntake, dancing in every sunbeam, all\nthe used up people.\nSHERLOCK\nFascinating, I\u2019m sure but won\u2019t you\n-\nMoriarty looks down the barrel of his gun. Blows dust out of\nit.\nMORIARTY\nPeople, people, people. You can\u2019t\nkeep anything shiny.\nHe puts his eye to the barrel of the gun, peers right down\nit. Places his thumb on the trigger.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nMind if I fire? Just to clean it\nout?\nSherlock stares at him - what? Then gets it. He tosses the\ngun aside.\n- and Moriarty lowers his.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nExactly. Let\u2019s stop playing. We\ndon\u2019t need toys to kill each other.\nWhere\u2019s the intimacy in that?\nSHERLOCK\nSit down.\nMORIARTY\nWhy? What do you want?\nSHERLOCK\nYou chose to come here -\nMORIARTY\nNot true - you know that\u2019s not\ntrue. What do you want??\nSherlock - taken aback for a moment.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n81.\nMORIARTY (CONT'D)\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nThe truth.\nMORIARTY\nOh, that!\nAs he says that word, Moriarty passes a mirror - just for an\ninstant, we see him reflected as we usually know him. Neat\nmodern suit, slicked back black hair.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\n(smiles)\nTruth\u2019s boring.\nMoriarty now sits opposite Sherlock.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nDidn\u2019t expect me to turn up at the\nscene of the crime, did you? Poor\nold Sir Eustace. He got what was\ncoming to him.\nSHERLOCK\nBut you couldn\u2019t have killed him.\nMORIARTY\nSo what? Does it matter? Oh, stop\nit. Stop this now. You don\u2019t care\nabout Sir Eustace, or the Bride, or\nany of it. There is only one thing\nin this whole business you find\ninteresting.\nSHERLOCK\nI know what you\u2019re doing.\nA slight tremor - as if there was the tiniest earthquake.\nGlassware shivers, tinkles.\nMORIARTY\nThe bride put a gun in her mouth,\nand shot the back of her head off -\nand then she came back. Impossible!\nBut she did it.\nThe whole room seems to lurch slightly. A few items fall\nover. Neither Sherlock not Moriarty react - what is\nhappening??\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nYou need to know how. Don\u2019t you?\nDon\u2019t you?? It\u2019s tearing your world\napart, not knowing.\nCutting round details of the room. Ornaments tinkle.\nPaintings tremble on the walls.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n82.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nSHERLOCK\nYou\u2019re trying to stop. Distract me,\nderail me.\nMORIARTY\nBecause doesn\u2019t this remind you on\nanother case? Didn\u2019t this all\nhappen before? There\u2019s nothing new\nunder the sun!\nSherlock: nothing!\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nWhat was that case? Do you\nremember? It\u2019s on the tip of my\ntongue.\nTosses the gun in his hand. Looks at it, idly.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nThe tip of my tongue ...\nHe extends his tongue, touches the end of the gun.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nThe tip ... of my ... tongue ...\nAnd he slides the gun into his mouth.\nSherlock - keeps it cool.\nSHERLOCK\nFor the sake Mrs Hudson\u2019s\nwallpaper, I\u2019m obliged to remind\nyou that one slip of your finger,\nand you\u2019ll be dead.\nMoriaty speaks - hmmph mmph mmph. Can\u2019t make it out, cos the\nthere\u2019s a gun in his mouth.\nSHERLOCK (CONT\u2019D)\nI\u2019m sorry?\nHmmph mmmph mph.\nMoriarty rolls his eyes, pulls the gun back out of his mouth.\nMORIARTY\nDead is the new sexy.\n- and he jams the gun back in his mouth, and BLAM!!\nBlood explodes over the wall behind him!\nAnd the whole room slants, as if we\u2019re on a banking plane.\nFurniture tumbles. Sherlock barely registers this, like it\ndoesn\u2019t matter -\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n83.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\n- because he\u2019s staring at -\nMoriarty, still just standing there, with slash of blood\nbehind him. He takes the gun out of his mouth.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nOh, I tell you what - that blows\nthe cobwebs away!\nSherlock, staring, in a thrill of horror.\nSHERLOCK\n... how can you be alive?\nMORIARTY\nHow do I look?\nHorror moment: Moriarty turns his head this way and that -\nand the back of his head is missing!!\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nBe honest - is it noticeable?\nSHERLOCK\nYou blew your own brains out - how\ncould you survive??\nFLASHBACK: sudden, jarring.

NIGHT 7108\n108\nWIDE\nThe two tiny figures on the lip of the precipice, the\nwaterfall roaring below them.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n114.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nIt begins to rain.\nCUT TO:\nSHERLOCK\nYou want to finish this?\nHe takes a sombre pace forward.\nMORIARTY\nThis is how we end, you and I.\nAlways here, always together.\nHe takes a pace forward too.\nSHERLOCK\nYou have a magnificent brain,\nMoriarty. I admire it. I conceded\nit may even be the equal of my own.\nPace.\nMORIARTY\nI\u2019m touched. I\u2019m honoured.\nPace. Almost face to face.\nSHERLOCK\nBut when it comes to the matter of\nunarmed combat on the edge of a\nprecipice ...\n(Looming over Moriarty, he\nnow stoops to look right\ninto his face - and\nmodern Sherlock bares his\nteeth)\n... you\u2019re going in the water,\nshort-arse.\nMoriarty grins up at him, delighted -\n- and then his face falls into a fearful mask of hatred. His\nhead oscialltes from side to side -\n- and he throws himself at Sherlock!\nThey grapple. Moriarty\u2019s fingers squeeze at Sherlock\u2019s face.\nSherlock manages to bring up his knee into Moriarty\u2019s\nstomach. Moriarty lurches, winded, then swings round his fist\nand slams it into Sherlock\u2019s chin.\nSherlock falls back onto the slippery ledge - as shocked as\nhe is winded -\nMORIARTY\nYou\u2019re big and strong, Sherlock.\nBut not with me.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n115.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nThe rain is falling heavily and Sherlock slips on the filthy\nblack soil as he struggles to get up.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nI am your weakness.\nMoriarty charges him again. Sherlock swings a fist - and\nmisses. Moriarty head-buts him and Sherlock goes down again.\nHe slides through the mud, closer to the edge of the\nwaterfall.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nI keep you down.\nAnd Moriarty\u2019s on him. Punches him again, again, again.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nWhen you stumble, when you fail ...\nevery time you\u2019re weak - I am\nthere!\nHe\u2019s yanked the dazed Sherlock half to his feet. His arms now\nwrapped around him from behind, he swings Sherlock round to\nlook out over the falls.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nI make you fall.\nSherlock tries to struggle - but Moriarty\u2019s grip is vice-\nlike.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nNo, no, baby, stop that, hush.\n(Almost nuzzling into him)\nDon\u2019t fight it. Lie back and lose,\nit\u2019s so relaxing.\nSherlock, blinking, disorientated.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nOh, are all those funny little\nchemicals fizzing your brain again.\nHere, let me splash some water on\nyour face.\nHe shuffles him closer to the edge. Weak as a kitten,\nSherlock tries to resist.\nMORIARTY (CONT\u2019D)\nShall we go over together? Are you\nread to say wheee? It has to be\ntogether, doesn\u2019t it. At the end,\nit\u2019s always just you and me.\nFrom off, a throat is cleared.\nMoriarty: what??\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n116.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nThe click of a gun being cocked.\nFrom off:\nJOHN\nProfessor, if you wouldn\u2019t mind\nstepping away from my friend - I do\nbelieve he finds your attention a\nshade annoying.\nMoriarty looks round in astonishment.\nThere\u2019s John Watson on the ledge, his gun levelled right at\nhim.\nMORIARTY\nOh, that\u2019s not fair. There\u2019s two of\nyou.\nJOHN\nThere\u2019s always two of us. Don\u2019t you\nread The Strand?\nMoriarty has stepped away from Sherlock, who now scrambles\nup.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nOn your knees, Professor. Hands\nbehind your head.\nMoriarty complies.\nSHERLOCK\nThank you, John.\nJOHN\nSince when do you call me John??\nSHERLOCK\nYou\u2019d be surprised.\nJOHN\nActually, I really wouldn\u2019t. Time\nyou woke up, Sherlock.\nSherlock at him surprise. John just smiles.\nJOHN (CONT\u2019D)\nI\u2019m a story teller. I know when I\u2019m\nin one.\nSherlock smiles. Always underestimates him.\nSHERLOCK\nOf course. Of course you do.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n117.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nJOHN\nWhat\u2019s he like? The other me in the\nother place?\nSHERLOCK\nSmarter than he looks.\nJOHN\nPretty damned smart then.\nSHERLOCK\nPretty damned smart.\nMORIARTY\nOh, why don\u2019t you two just elope,\nfor God\u2019s sake?\nJOHN\nAnnoying.\nSHERLOCK\nOffensive.\nJOHN\nActually, would you mind?\nSHERLOCK\nNot at all.\nJohn steps casually forward -\n- and kicks Moriarty hard. Moriarty flails, screams, and\nplunges, disappearing down into the torrent.\nJOHN\nIt was my turn.\nSHERLOCK\nQuite so.\nBeat.\nJOHN\nSo how do you plan to wake up?\nSHERLOCK\nOh, I should think, like this.\nSherlock steps to the ledge, spreads his arms, just as he did\nin The Reichenbach Fall.\nJOHN\nAre you sure?\nSHERLOCK\nBetween you and me, John, I always\nsurvive a fall.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n118.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nJOHN\nBut how?\nSHERLOCK\nElementary, my dear Watson.\nAnd he dives from the ledge.\nClose on Sherlock - a surreal, slow motion swan dive through\nthe raging spray and raging torrent.\nHe smiles....\nCUT TO:\nINT. PRIVATE PLANE. DAY 6\n109\n109\n- and SHERLOCK opens his eyes with a great whooping gasp!\nLooking down at him in the plane seat - JOHN, MARY, MYCROFT,\nDIAMOND. Even the PILOT.\nSherlock is deathly pale, sweating.\nSherlock passes a hand over his eyes. It was a close run\nthing.\nHe smiles up at his friends.\nSHERLOCK\nMiss me?\nJOHN\nSherlock? Are you all right?\nHe\u2019s sitting up, groggy, but pulling himself together.\nSHERLOCK\nOf course I\u2019m all right. Why\nwouldn\u2019t I be all right?\nMARY\nBecause you probably just OD\u2019d. You\nshould be in a hospital.\nSHERLOCK\nThere isn\u2019t time. Baker Street, now\n- Moriarty\u2019s back.\nHe\u2019s on his feet -\n- but Mycroft is blocking his.\nMYCROFT\nI almost hope he is.\n(holds up the list)\nIf it\u2019ll save you from this.\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n119.\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\nA moment.\nSherlock takes the list - and tears it in half, tosses it\naway.\nSHERLOCK\nNo need for that. I\u2019ve got the real\nthing now. I\u2019ve got work to do.\nBut Mycroft, not budging, so serious. Haunted, worlds\nunspoken.\nMYCROFT\nSherlock ... promise me.\nSHERLOCK\nWhy are you still here. Shouldn\u2019t\nyou be off arranging me a pardon,\nor something? Like a proper big\nbrother?\nHe pushes past, strides.\nA moment. Mycroft kneels, carefully retrieves the torn list,\npreserving the pieces.\nAs Mary and John move to follow Sherlock -\nMYCROFT\nDr. Watson ...\nJohn turns. Mycroft, kneeling on the floor, torn list in\nhand. Never looked more vulnerable.\nMYCROFT (CONT\u2019D)\nLook after him. Please.\nA beat on John. A stiff little nod. And he and Mary go.\nWe hold on Mycroft, as he slips the torn pieces into a slim\nnotebook he has retrieved from his jacket. It is a fairly old\nnotebook, packed with Mycroft\u2019s handwriting.\nWe glimpse a page of notes, headed with the single word:\nReadbeard -\n- before he snaps the notebook shut!\n(If we can make this seem to be the same notebook Mycroft had\nin A Study In Pink - in his first meeting with John - so much\nthe better!)\nCUT TO:\nSHERLOCK SPECIAL - LILAC SHOOTING SCRIPT - 04/02/15\n120.\n\n\n"

I said\nhe was back.\nMARY\nThen he\u2019s dead.\nSHERLOCK\nOf course he\u2019s dead! He blew his\nown brains out, no one survives\nthat.

And\nhow you and I might fit inside it.\nFrom a drop of water a logician\nshould be able to infer the\npossibility of an Atlantic or a\nNiagara.\nJOHN\nOr a Reichenbach?\nBeat.\nSHERLOCK\nYou\u2019ve written up your own account\nof the case?\nJOHN\nYes.\nSHERLOCK\nModified to put it down as one of\nmy rare failures, of course?\nJOHN\nOf course.\nSHERLOCK\n\u2018The Adventure of the Invisible\nArmy\u2019? \u2018The League of Furies\u2019? \u2018The\nMonstrous Regiment\u2019?\nJOHN\nI rather thought...\u2019The Abominable\nBride\u2019.\nBeat.\nSHERLOCK\nA trifle lurid.\nJOHN\nIt\u2019ll sell.
